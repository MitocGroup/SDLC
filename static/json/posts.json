Quoting from official source:</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\"><em>AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and <strong>require a deep understanding of AWS services.</strong></em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">The AWS Landing Zone solution reduced by a lot the complexity and the consistency of similar design patterns provided to different customers. On the other hand, our team had to rebuild some CloudFormation components as Terraform components, in order to use them further down the automation pipeline.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">So we asked ourselves: Why not to build the entire AWS Landing Zone solution in Terraform? Would that be feasible and would that solve our customers problems? Spoiler alert: It is and it does :)</p>\n<h3>When NOT to Use AWS Landing Zone?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">If you are managing your cloud services and cloud resources within one or two AWS accounts, this solution might be an overkill for you. Everybody else, please continue reading :)</p>\n<h3>What to Consider Before Getting Started?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">Many large organizations we have worked with do have some kind of cloud strategy already in place. Without a clear vision and clear expectations, companies struggle to adopt cloud services successfully. Please consider spending some time in order to define your own cloud strategy and how does AWS fit into that strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">Once the strategy is in place, successful AWS Landing Zone customers have considered proactively the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Automation is NOT an option. Cloud native automation is preferred.</li>\n<li>Teams are consistently using the same pipelines with the same toolset for cloud resources provisioning. Terraform is preferred.\n3.Cloud champions are empowered to build reusable processes and expose them as reusable services instead of reusable code. Serverless architecture is preferred.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Introducing Terraform Module for AWS Landing Zone</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">After a couple of months of hard work, it is my pleasure to introduce terraform module for AWS Landing Zone (see above link). <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone\">Source code</a> is managed using GitHub and <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone\">stable releases</a> are published on Terraform Module Registry.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">To get started, simply include main.tf into your terraform codebase:</p>\n<pre><code>module \"landing_zone\" {\n  source     = \"TerraHubCorp/landing-zone/aws\"\n  version    = \"0.0.6\"\n  root_path  = \"${path.module}\"\n  account_id = \"${var.account_id}\"\n  region     = \"${var.region}\"\n  landing_zone_components = \"${var.landing_zone_components}\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">NOTE: Make sure to include <em>variables.tf</em> and whatever makes sense from outputs.tf</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">To simplify and make it easier to understand, we included default values in <em>terraform.tfvars</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>account_id = \"123456789012\"\nregion = \"us-east-1\"\nlanding_zone_components = {\n  landing_zone_pipeline_s3_bucket = \"s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/landing_zone_pipeline_s3_bucket/default.tfvars\"\n  [...]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">This means that when you use this terraform module, you will need to:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Change <em>account_id</em> and <em>region</em> to values that correspond to your AWS Organization</li>\n<li>Change <em>landing</em>zone<em>components</em> to values that fit into your AWS Landing Zone use case</li>\n<li>Change <em>s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany</em> to your S3 bucket and S3 key prefix where you will be storing .tfvars files (or absolute path to .tfvars files on local disk)\nThis module can have tens, hundreds or thousands of deployable components, but not all of them should be and will be deployed. At runtime, components that are not part of <em>landing_zone_components</em> map variable will be ignored.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">We are very excited and proud of sharing some fruits of our continuous effort to help customers build cloud native automation. Terraform module for AWS Landing Zone is just another solution that helps organizations more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. We are well aware that AWS evolves with an insanely fast pace, and we are committed to evolve this terraform powered solution that covers all the basics, as well as integrates with other successful solutions on AWS.</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">TerraHub.io is the DevOps Hub for Terraform Automation. We provide managed services that simplify cloud resources management using terraform.

We thought of adding julienned mango to compliment the sweet \nand sour taste and bring more texture to the salad. The result was more stunning than we thought and our families devoured it to the \nlast piece. It is important to choose a green, unripe papaya as it is richer in digestive enzymes than the ripe ones. It will also give \na crunchy texture to the salad. For the dressing we opted for a vegan version by substituting the fish sauce with pineapple juice and \nusing coconut sugar instead of white sugar. You can also omit the sugar all together depending how sweet your mango is and how sweet you \nlike your salads. \nWhat we like most about this salad is that it is loaded with vitamins A, C, E, folate, antioxidants, fiber, beta-carotene, \ndigestive enzymes and many more healthy nutrients. The ingredients in this Papaya and Mango Salad possess anticancer properties , reduce \ninflammatory markers, boost heart health, improve digestion, decrease the risk of macular degeneration and protect against skin damage. \nSo next time you’re in the supermarket grab the greenest papaya and treat your to this delicious and healthy salad.</p>\n<h1>Author</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">Blooming Aprons</p>\n<h1>PrepTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">25 min</p>\n<h1>CookTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">3 min</p>\n<h1>TotalTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">30 min</p>\n<h1>Servings</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">6-8</p>\n<h1>Ingredients</h1>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>1/2 medium size green papaya peeled and seeded</li>\n<li>1 firm green mango peeled </li>\n<li>3 carrots </li>\n<li>15 green beans </li>\n<li>15 snow peas </li>\n<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes halved </li>\n<li>4-5 scallions chopped </li>\n<li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro loosely packed plus 1 tbsp </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>- 2-3 oz roasted peanuts plus more for decoration </h2>\n<h3>For dressing:</h3>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>5 tbsp lime juice </li>\n<li>2 tbsp coconut sugar </li>\n<li>1 tbsp tamari</li>\n<li>1 tbsp pineapple juice </li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Directions</h1>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Using a mandolin or julienne peeler julien the green papaya, green mango and the carrots and add to a large mixing bowl.</li>\n<li>Bring water to boil in a small pot and blanch green beans and snow peas for 3 min .
