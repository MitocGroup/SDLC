Did I mention it is healthy too? \nWild Salmon is loaded with numerous health benefits, like improving cardiovascular health due to being rich in Omega-3 fatty acids and \npotassium, it is a good source of vitamin B complex, promotes brain health and many more. I always recommend wild salmon over farmed one \nas it has far less potentially harmful contaminants, however given the many health benefits, any type of salmon is still considered a \nhealthy food. \nThis recipe for Lemon Garlic Roasted Salmon comes out perfect every time, it is fail proof! The process is pretty simple, just assemble \nthe marinade, brush it on the salmon and roast then broil it.

We love combining sweet and tart flavors, \nraspberries and mangoes do not disappoint. The tartness of raspberries combined with buttery sweet mango is what makes this tart’s \ndelectable flavor. We recommend using our Raspberry Chia Jam for this recipe as it is low in sugar  and has a rich raspberry flavor, \nbut if you don’t have it on hand or don’t have the time to prepare it, you can use store bought preserves, it will still taste incredible. </p>\n<h1>Author</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">Blooming Aprons</p>\n<h1>PrepTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">25 min</p>\n<h1>CookTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">20 min</p>\n<h1>TotalTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">45 min</p>\n<h1>Servings</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">8</p>\n<h1>Ingredients</h1>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>2/3 cup almond meal</li>\n<li>1/3 cup hazelnut flour/meal</li>\n<li>1 cup oat flour</li>\n<li>1 tbsp flax meal</li>\n<li>1/4 cup coconut sugar</li>\n<li>Pinch of salt</li>\n<li>1/4 coconut oil</li>\n<li>2 tbsp water for blending</li>\n<li>2 ripe Champagne Mangos</li>\n<li>1 cup of Raspberry Chia Jam</li>\n<li>3 Tbsp of Apricot Jelly for the glaze</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Directions</h1>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Tart crust: Preheat the oven at 350 F. Line a 9 inch tart pan with parchment paper and brush all over with coconut oil. Place the almond meal, hazelnut flour, oat flour, coconut sugar, salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times until combined.

Layer the mango slices beginning from the edges and going to the middle of the crust in circles. </li>\n<li>Prepare the glaze: Heat the apricot jelly in a small saucepan stirring until smooth.

The flavor, texture and the exotic look \nmade us dream of recreating and adding it to our collection of recipes. We thought of adding julienned mango to compliment the sweet \nand sour taste and bring more texture to the salad. The result was more stunning than we thought and our families devoured it to the \nlast piece. It is important to choose a green, unripe papaya as it is richer in digestive enzymes than the ripe ones. It will also give \na crunchy texture to the salad. For the dressing we opted for a vegan version by substituting the fish sauce with pineapple juice and \nusing coconut sugar instead of white sugar. You can also omit the sugar all together depending how sweet your mango is and how sweet you \nlike your salads. \nWhat we like most about this salad is that it is loaded with vitamins A, C, E, folate, antioxidants, fiber, beta-carotene, \ndigestive enzymes and many more healthy nutrients. The ingredients in this Papaya and Mango Salad possess anticancer properties , reduce \ninflammatory markers, boost heart health, improve digestion, decrease the risk of macular degeneration and protect against skin damage. \nSo next time you’re in the supermarket grab the greenest papaya and treat your to this delicious and healthy salad.</p>\n<h1>Author</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">Blooming Aprons</p>\n<h1>PrepTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">25 min</p>\n<h1>CookTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">3 min</p>\n<h1>TotalTime</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">30 min</p>\n<h1>Servings</h1>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up\">6-8</p>\n<h1>Ingredients</h1>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>1/2 medium size green papaya peeled and seeded</li>\n<li>1 firm green mango peeled </li>\n<li>3 carrots </li>\n<li>15 green beans </li>\n<li>15 snow peas </li>\n<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes halved </li>\n<li>4-5 scallions chopped </li>\n<li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro loosely packed plus 1 tbsp </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>- 2-3 oz roasted peanuts plus more for decoration </h2>\n<h3>For dressing:</h3>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>5 tbsp lime juice </li>\n<li>2 tbsp coconut sugar </li>\n<li>1 tbsp tamari</li>\n<li>1 tbsp pineapple juice </li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Directions</h1>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Using a mandolin or julienne peeler julien the green papaya, green mango and the carrots and add to a large mixing bowl.</li>\n<li>Bring water to boil in a small pot and blanch green beans and snow peas for 3 min .
