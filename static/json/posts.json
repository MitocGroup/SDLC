Cloud Computing has emerged as one of the most viable routes for enterprise software delivery and, in our experience, Amazon Web Services is leading the charge. In this article, we will describe how we combined [1] Serverless Infrastructure from AWS with [2] Microservices Architecture to build and deploy a worry-free enterprise software marketplace we’re calling the <a href=\"https://www.deep.mg/\">DEEP Marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: We will assume that you have general knowledge about below 2 concepts (or read suggested articles in parenthesis to learn more)</em></p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li><em>Serverless Computing (learn more — Microservices without the Servers)</em></li>\n<li><em>Microservices Architecture (learn more — Microservices by Martin Fowler)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Enterprise software is <a href=\"http://www.mycustomer.com/selling/crm/enterprise-software-sucks-says-ceo-of-enterprise-software-firm-infor\">not attractive</a> because traditionally it’s slow, architecturally monolithic and cumbersome to operate. Enterprise IT organizations are commonly overwhelmed by the technology they maintain and there aren’t enough hours in a day to address the backlog of work. That’s why the process of buying typical enterprise solution that solves a given business problem must include an evaluation of how easily it can be customized for specific use case along with a thorough understanding of the ongoing costs of day-to-day operations. That’s why savvy enterprise technology teams are constantly seeking software that empowers business users to be self-sufficient through self-service.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">At <a href=\"https://www.mitocgroup.com/\">Mitoc Group</a>, we believe that the most sustainable solution to enterprise software challenges is a marketplace of small pieces of functionality. Customers, especially non-technical users, can go to the marketplace, search for the functionality that they need, drag selected components into their shopping cart and push a button that will create a custom web application in their AWS account. This is similar to Lego Store, where customers buy lego pieces to build customized solutions at their will or pick from existing pre-packaged offers.</p>\n<h3>Building a Sample Application</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this post, we leverage open source software, while maintaining compliance with enterprise requirements. The sample application is a simple task management application, aka todo app, inspired by <a href=\"http://www.todomvc.com/\">www.todomvc.com</a> and accessible at <a href=\"http://todo.deep.mg/\">todo.deep.mg</a>. We will walk through the codebase and show how to build and deploy it as a scalable, yet serverless, custom web application.</p>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-02-12/serverless.png\" alt=\"serverless microservices\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">Serverless microservices at core of www.deep.mg</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The architecture that we have been using for over six months now can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>Security: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS IAM</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a></li>\n<li>Frontend: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a></li>\n<li>Backend: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">Amazon API Gateway</a></li>\n<li>Database: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">Amazon SQS</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\">Amazon ElastiCache</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The backbone of our approach is known as serverless microservices. We use AWS Lambda as our core computing service. Security by design is enforced by AWS IAM and we cache as much as possible, in every layer, to improve the performance and reduce the costs of running the web application.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Amazon S3 is only capable of serving static assets so we must rely on browser-based JavaScript to provide dynamic functionality. Our team selected <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a> as frontend framework, but you can use any other JavaScript framework that you’re most comfortable with.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We developed <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework\">DEEP Framework</a> — a home-grown and open-source serverless web framework — and supporting <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepify\">DEEP CLI</a> — the development tool-chain — that has evolved through real-world use to increase our agility by:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>Streamlined local development</li>\n<li>Abstracted use of cloud services</li>\n<li>Automated allocation of infrastructure resources</li>\n<li>Zero devops and out-of-the-box scalability</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>So, let’s get started…</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">You will need the following pre-requisites:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS Account (learn how to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WviHsoz8yHk\">Create an Amazon Web Services Account</a>)</li>\n<li>AWS CLI (learn how to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html\">Configure AWS Command Line Interface</a>)</li>\n<li>Node.js (learn how to <a href=\"http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs\">Install Node.js</a>)</li>\n<li>DEEP CLI (execute in command line: <em>npm install deepify</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Next, deploy the todo app using the DEEP CLI:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li><em>deepify install https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app.git ~/deep-todo-app</em></li>\n<li><em>deepify server ~/deep-todo-app</em></li>\n<li><em>deepify deploy ~/deep-todo-app</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: When step 2 (deepify server) is finished, you can open in your browser <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a> and enjoy the todo app running locally.</em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture\">Services Oriented Architecture</a>. Every frontend interaction is powered by a backend service that talks to a data tier. The web application is a collection of web components (we call them microapplications). Every web component consists of a frontend, backend, database, security, tests and docs. And every microapplication manages the entire technology stack, starting with infrastructure services, going up to platform services and concluding with application services, everything packaged as a well-structured codebase.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: Docs and tests are very important components of every microapplication, but we decided to leave them out of scope for this article.</em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Let’s dive into the details of every tier next…</p>\n<h4>Building Frontend</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The structure of our frontend is concentrated into: <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Frontend/bootstrap.js\">bootstrap.js</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Frontend/package.json\">package.json</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/tree/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Frontend/js/\">js/</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">/* global System */\n'use strict';\n'format es6';\n\nexport default function todo() {\n  var deepAsset = DeepFramework.Kernel.container.get('asset');\n  return System.import(deepAsset.locate('@deep.todo:js/app/angular/index.js'));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">bootstrap.js — the bootstrap file used by frontend as execution’s entry point</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"todomvc-app-css\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"todomvc-common\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">package.json — the metadata file used by deepify to resolve dependencies and automate the deployment</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">js/\n  app/\n    angular/\n      controllers/\n        DeepTodoController.js\n        index.js\n      directives/\n        index.js\n        taskEscape.js\n        taskFocus.js\n      module/\n        index.js\n        ng-config.js\n        ng-module.js\n        ng-routes.js\n      services/\n        DeepTodoService.js\n        index.js\n      views/\n        layout.html\n        todo.html\n      index.js\n      name.js\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">js/ — the folder that contains application code / AngularJS in our case</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">As was mentioned earlier in this post, this todo app was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.todomvc.com/\">www.todomvc.com</a>. In practice, it means that we took <a href=\"https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angularjs\">the sample code from GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-helloworld\">ported using Hello World as reference</a>. Reusing code allows us to be both consistent and fast.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Microservices architecture can be challenging sometimes. We found very useful the process of building a feature or a service first, and then break it down into microservices. Using this approach on todo app helped us take the code as it was, replace <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router\">AngularUI Router</a> modules with <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-root-angularjs\">DEEP Microservices Root AngularJS</a>, and transform the storage service using resource library from DEEP Framework.</p>\n<h4>Building Backend</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The structure of our backend is reduced to: <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Backend/resources.json\">resources.json</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/tree/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Backend/src/\">src/</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"task\": {\n    \"create\": {\n      \"description\": \"Lambda that creates todo task\",\n      \"type\": \"lambda\",\n      \"methods\": [\"POST\"],\n      \"source\": \"src/Task/Create\"\n    },\n    \"retrieve\": {\n      \"description\": \"Lambda that retrieves todo task\",\n      \"type\": \"lambda\",\n      \"methods\": [\"GET\"],\n      \"source\": \"src/Task/Retrieve\"\n    },\n    \"delete\": {\n      \"description\": \"Lambda that deletes todo task\",\n      \"type\": \"lambda\",\n      \"methods\": [\"DELETE\"],\n      \"source\": \"src/Task/Delete\"\n    },\n    \"update\": {\n      \"description\": \"Lambda that updates todo task\",\n      \"type\": \"lambda\",\n      \"methods\": [\"PUT\"],\n      \"source\": \"src/Task/Update\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">resources.json — the resources file used by deepify to map and deploy each microservice’s codebase</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">src/\n  Task/\n    Create/\n      Handler.es6\n      bootstrap.es6\n      package.json\n    Delete/\n      Handler.es6\n      bootstrap.es6\n      package.json\n    Retrieve/\n      Handler.es6\n      bootstrap.es6\n      package.json\n    Update/\n      Handler.es6\n      bootstrap.es6\n      package.json\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">src/ — the folder that contains microservices code / Node.js in our case</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">When the UI and UX were defined, building the web services to support this frontend were intuitively easy. We are using RESTful APIs that provide CRUD (aka Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) operations for each logically independent entity. In our case the entity is the todo task, and our todo app is supposed to offer functionality to create tasks, retrieve them, update or delete.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Each web service we use is very small, completely independent, highly decoupled, focused on context bounded one task, communicating through language-agnostic API. This is the very definition of a microservice, which we adopted by choice and by necessity. And this is where AWS Lambda excels!</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Next, we will describe the structure of the “Create Todo” microservice that we deploy on AWS Lambda (the other microservices in this todo app are structured pretty much the same): <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Backend/src/Todo/Create/bootstrap.es6\">bootstrap.es6</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Backend/src/Todo/Create/package.json\">package.json</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Backend/src/Todo/Create/Handler.es6\">Handler.es6</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"es6 language-es6\">'use strict';\n\nimport DeepFramework from 'deep-framework';\nimport Handler from './Handler';\n\nexport default DeepFramework.LambdaHandler(Handler);\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">bootstrap.es6 — the bootstrap file used by backend as execution’s entry point</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"name\": \"deep-todo-task-create\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"description\": \"Create a new todo task\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"npm run compile\",\n    \"compile\": \"deepify compile-es6 `pwd`\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"deep-framework\": \"^1.8.x\"\n  },\n  \"preferGlobal\": false,\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"analyze\": true\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">package.json — the metadata file used by deepify to resolve dependencies and automate the deployment</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"es6 language-es6\">'use strict';\n\nimport DeepFramework from 'deep-framework';\n\nexport default class extends DeepFramework.Core.AWS.Lambda.Runtime {\n  constructor(...args) {\n    super(...args);\n  }\n\n  handle(request) {\n    let TodoModel = this.kernel.get('db').get('Todo');\n    TodoModel.createItem(request.data, (err, todo) =&gt; {\n      if (err) {\n        throw new DeepFramework.Core.Exception.DatabaseOperationException(err);\n      }\n      return this.createResponse(todo.get()).send();\n    });\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">Handler.es6 — the actual microservice that creates the record in the Todo table</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Building Database</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The structure of our database model is trivial, just one file: <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/Data/Models/Todo.json\">Todo.json</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"Title\": \"string\",\n  \"Completed\": \"boolean\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">Todo.json — the schema file that defines the table name and the primary key / everything else is optional</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Since we’re using a NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB, the only piece of information that the database library from DEEP Framework cares about is the table name and the primary key. Everything else is handled by the library itself, as long as it’s in json format.</p>\n<h4>Enforcing Security</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design. When we deploy todo app, <em>deepify</em> automatically identifies the web services involved in the process and creates corresponding security roles. On backend and database tiers these roles are transposed into AWS IAM roles, while on frontend tier we automatically compile them and expose in the UI as Access Control Lists (also known as ACLs). Let’s see some examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"Version\": \"2015-10-07\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"deep.todo:task:create\"],\n      \"Resource\": [\"deep.todo:task\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">DEEP role to allow Task Create execution / deep.todo — microapplication ID</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\"lambda:InvokeFunction\"],\n            \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789000:function:DeepProdTodoCreate1234abcd*\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">IAM role to allow Lambda invocation / 123456789000 — AWS account number / abcd1234 — deepify deploy ID</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Putting Everything Together</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Now that we’re done with frontend, backend, database and security, it’s time to glue everything together and put all web components into action:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">DeepTodo/\n  Backend/\n  Data/\n  Docs/\n  Frontend/\n  Tests/\n  deepkg.json\n  hook.init.js\n  parameters.json\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">DeepNgTodo — the structure of our todo app</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">There are two more components in the root path of the microapplication that are critical: <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/deepkg.json\">deepkg.json</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app/blob/master/src/DeepNgToDo/parameters.json\">parameters.json</a>. Similar to Node Package Manager (also know as <em>npm</em>), our command line tool DEEP CLI (also known as <em>deepify</em>) is looking for metadata (in this case — deepkg.json) and configuration (in this case — parameters.json) files. Additionally, <em>deepify</em> can be enriched with hooks (in this case — hook.init.js) that allow flexibility and customization of the deployment process:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"identifier\": \"deep.todo\",\n  \"name\": \"DeepTodo\",\n  \"description\": \"DeepTodo Microapplication\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"propertyRoot\": false,\n  \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"Mitoc Group\",\n    \"email\": \"hello@mitocgroup.com\",\n    \"website\": \"http://www.mitocgroup.com\"\n  },\n  \"contributors\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"DEEP Team\",\n      \"email\": \"hello@deep.mg\",\n      \"website\": \"https://www.deep.mg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"frontendEngine\": [\"angular\"],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">deepkg.json — the metadata file used by deepify to resolve dependencies and automate the deployment</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">{\n  \"frontend\": {},\n  \"backend\": {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">parameters.json — the parameters file that allows configuration and customization of microapplications</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">'use strict';\n\nvar exports = module.exports = function(callback) {\n  var exec = require(\"child_process\").exec;\n  var path = require('path');\n  var source = path.join(__dirname, 'Frontend/learn.json');\n  var dist = path.join(__dirname, '../DeepNgRoot/Frontend');\n\n  exec('cp ' + source + ' ' + dist, function(error, stdout, stderr) {\n    if (error) {\n      console.error('Error while copying learn.json', error);\n      callback();\n      return;\n    }\n    console.log('learn.json was successfully copied into DeepNgRoot');\n    callback();\n  })\n};\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">hook.init.js — the hook file that executes at deploy init / copies learn.json file into root microapplication</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Hopefully the deployment execution that was described in <em>Getting Started</em> section is done by now. If everything went well, you will see 2 URLs in the last rows of the terminal’s output window: S3 Website Endpoint and CloudFront Distribution. Open in the browser any of the URLs and you’ll see the todo app running in your own AWS account.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: The distribution takes up to 20 minutes to provision, therefore don’t worry if it returns an HTTP error in the first couple of minutes.</em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Below video playlist summarizes the steps that we’ve walked you through:</p>\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghZNn5Gjv90?list=PLPGfD-tGOl7uNDXo_eMN1odMZflYVu2n9\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3>Scalability Benchmarking</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Even though SPAs (aka Single-Page Applications) are <a href=\"http://www.soasta.com/blog/angularjs-real-user-monitoring-single-page-applications\">challenging to monitor and benchmark</a>, we have load tested the todo app in order to associate some numbers to how big it can scale using out-of-the-box configurations. We found that standard setup gives us acceptable response time (within 2 seconds) for up to 10,000 concurrent users per second, at “my Starbucks coffee costs more” price tag:</p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<th>Concurrency (in users/sec)</th>\n<th>Capacity Peak (in reads/sec)</th>\n<th>Average Response (in ms)</th>\n<th>Total Requests (in 1min)</th>\n<th>Average Cost (in $/min)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">14</td>\n<td class=\"center\">529</td>\n<td class=\"center\">5,984</td>\n<td class=\"center\">$0.000013</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1,000</td>\n<td class=\"center\">18</td>\n<td class=\"center\">1,003</td>\n<td class=\"center\">59,446</td>\n<td class=\"center\">$0.000141</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">5,000</td>\n<td class=\"center\">12</td>\n<td class=\"center\">1,724</td>\n<td class=\"center\">219,027</td>\n<td class=\"center\">$0.000825</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">10,000</td>\n<td class=\"center\">17</td>\n<td class=\"center\">2,152</td>\n<td class=\"center\">274,518</td>\n<td class=\"center\">$0.001898</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: These numbers can be improved with additional complexity and features that are beyond the scope of this article</em></p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>The sample web application described in this article is a simple example of how we are building and deploying enterprise software using serverless microservices on AWS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app\">DEEP Todo App</a> is powered by DEEP Framework.

We were tired of the opposite, spending 80% of our time on 20% of results. And AWS Lambda played fundamental role in making it happen.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Fast-forward one year later, we still aim high and dream big. We are building scalable products in weeks that normally takes months. Our customers love the fact that speed, security and efficiency come out of the box.

We are a small group of developers who are helping customers with their entire web development process, from conception through execution and down to maintenance. Being in the business of doing everything is very hard, and it would be impossible without using AWS foundational services, but we incrementally needed more. That is why we became earlier adopters of serverless approach and developed an ecosystem called <a href=\"https://www.mitocgroup.com/partners/aws-lambda/index.html\">Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform</a> (shortly DEEP) with AWS Lambda at core.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this post, we will dive deeper into how DEEP is leveraging AWS Lambda to empower developers build cloud-native applications or platforms using microservices architecture. We will walk through the thinking process of identifying the front-end, the back-end and the data tiers required to build web applications with AWS Lambda at core. We will focus on the structure of AWS Lambda functions we use, as well as security, performance and benchmarking steps that we take to build enterprise-level web applications.</p>\n<h3>Enterprise-level Web Applications</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Our approach to web development is full-stack and user-driven, focused on UI (aka User Interaction) and UX (aka User eXperience). But before going into the details, we’d like to emphasize the strategical (biased and opinionated) decisions we have made early:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>We don’t say “no” to customers; Every problem is seriously evaluated and sometimes we offer options that involve our direct competitors</li>\n<li>We are developers and we focus only on the application level; Everything else (platform level and infrastructure level) must be managed by AWS</li>\n<li>We focus our 20% of effort to solve 80% of work load; Everything must be automated and pushed on the services side rather than ours (clients)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">To be honest and fair, it doesn’t work all the time as expected, but it does help us to learn fast and move quickly, sustainably and incrementally solving business problems through technical solutions that really matters. But the definition of “really matters” is different from customer to customer, quite unique in some cases. Nevertheless, what we learn from our customers is that enterprise-level web applications must provide the following 7 common expectations:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Be secure — security through obscurity (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">Amazon IAM</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a>);</li>\n<li>Be compliant — governance-focused, audit-friendly service features with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/\">applicable compliance or audit standards</a>;</li>\n<li>Be reliable — Service Level Agreements (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/\">Amazon S3</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/sla/\">Amazon CloudFront</a>);</li>\n<li>Be performant — studies show that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@puppybits/letting-people-in-the-door-how-and-why-to-get-page-loads-under-2-seconds-340c487bd81d\">page loads longer than 2s start impacting the users behavior</a>;</li>\n<li>Be pluggable — <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/doc/371379/best-practices-key-successful-application\">successful enterprise ecosystem</a> is mainly driven by fully integrated web applications inside organizations;</li>\n<li>Be cost-efficient — benefit of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/\">AWS Free Tier</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/\">pay only for services that you use and when you use them</a>;</li>\n<li>Be scalable — serverless approach relies on abstracted services that are pre-scaled to AWS size, <a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/article/aws-now-10x-the-size-of-its-competitors-is-the-cloud-arms-race-over/\">whatever that would be</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This article will describe how we have transformed a self-managed task management application (aka todo app) in minutes. The original version can be seen on <a href=\"http://www.todomvc.com%2C/\">www.todomvc.com</a> and the original code can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angularjs\">https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angularjs</a>.\nThe architecture of every web application we build or transform, including the one described above, is similar to the reference architecture of the realtime voting application published recently by AWS on Github:</p>\n<div class=\"external-article\">\n  <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone/aws?source=post_page-----3e566ee6e73f----------------------\">\n  <h5>awslabs/lambda-refarch-webapp</h5>\n  <span>lambda-refarch-webapp — AWS Lambda Reference Architecture for creating a Web Application</span>\n    <span>github.com</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The todo app is written in AngularJS and deployed on Amazon S3, behind Amazon CloudFront (the front-end tier). The tasks management is processed by AWS Lambda, optionally behind Amazon API Gateway (the back-end tier). The tasks metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB (the data tier). The transformed todo app, along with instructions on how to install and deploy this web application, is described in <a href=\"https://blog.mitocgroup.com/building-scalable-web-apps-with-aws-lambda-and-home-grown-serverless-web-framework-e04c912d08f0\">this blog post</a> and the code is available on Github:</p>\n<div class=\"external-article\">\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todo-app?source=post_page-----dd81719b0dff----------------------\">\n  <h5>MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todomvc</h5>\n  <span>DEEP Todo App ( https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todomvc) is a web app inspired from AngularJS TodoMVC…</span>\n    <span>github.com</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this article, we will focus on AWS Lambda functions and the value proposition it offers to us and our customers.</p>\n<h3>AWS Lambda Functions</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Let’s get into the details of the thinking process and the AWS Lambda functions that we have written for this web app. The goal of the todo app is to manage tasks in a self-service mode. End users can view tasks, create new tasks, mark or unmark a task as done, and clear completed tasks. From UI and UX point of view, that leads us to 4 user interactions that will require 4 different back-end calls:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>web service that retrieves task(s)</li>\n<li>web service that creates task(s)</li>\n<li>web service that deletes task(s)</li>\n<li>web service that updates task(s)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Simple reorder of the above identified back-end calls leads us to basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on the Task data object. And these are the simple logical steps that we take to identify the front-end, the back-end and the data tiers of (drums beating, trumpets playing) our approach to microservices, which we prefer to call microapplications.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Therefore, coming back to AWS Lambda, we have written 4 small node.js functions that are context-bounded and self-sustained (each below microservice corresponds to the above identified back-end web service):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">'use strict';\n\nimport DeepFramework from 'deep-framework';\n\nexport default class Handler extends DeepFramework.Core.AWS.Lambda.Runtime {\n  /**\n   * @param {Array} args\n   */\n  constructor(...args) {\n    super(...args);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @param request\n   */\n  handle(request) {\n    let taskId = request.getParam('Id');\n\n    if (taskId) {\n      this.retrieveTask(taskId, (task) =&gt; {\n        return this.createResponse(task).send();\n      });\n    } else {\n      this.retrieveAllTasks((result) =&gt; {\n        return this.createResponse(result).send();\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @param {Function} callback\n   */\n  retrieveAllTasks(callback) {\n    let TaskModel = this.kernel.get('db').get('Task');\n\n    TaskModel.findAll((err, task) =&gt; {\n      if (err) {\n        throw new DeepFramework.Core.Exception.DatabaseOperationException(err);\n      }\n\n      return callback(task.Items);\n    });\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @param {String} taskId\n   * @param {Function} callback\n   */\n  retrieveTask(taskId, callback) {\n    let TaskModel = this.kernel.get('db').get('Task');\n\n    TaskModel.findOneById(taskId, (err, task) =&gt; {\n      if (err) {\n        throw new DeepFramework.Core.Exception.DatabaseOperationException(err);\n      }\n\n      return callback(task ? task.get() : null);\n    });\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">1.

If you’re new to this process, we’d strongly recommend to follow <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitEclipse/latest/ug/lambda-tutorial.html\">How to Create, Upload and Invoke an AWS Lambda function</a> tutorial.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Back to our 4 small node.js functions, you can see that we have adopted ES6 (aka <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015\">ES2015</a>) as our coding standard. And we are importing deep-framework in every function. What is this framework anyway and why we’re using it everywhere?</p>\n<h3>Full-stack Web Framework</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Let us step back. Building and uploading AWS Lambda functions to the service is very simple and straight-forward, but now imagine you need to manage 100–150 web services to access a web page, multiplied by hundreds or thousands of web pages.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We believe that the only way to achieve this kind of flexibility and scale is automation and code reuse. These principles led us to build and open source <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework\">DEEP Framework</a> — a full-stack web framework that abstracts web services and web applications from specific cloud services — and DEEP CLI (aka <em>deepify</em>) — development tool-chain that abstracts package management and associated development operations.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Therefore, to make sure that the process of managing AWS Lambda functions is streamlined and automated, we have adopted a consistent approach to include 2 more files in each uploaded .zip:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">'use strict';\n\nimport DeepFramework from 'deep-framework';\nimport Handler from './Handler';\n\nexport default DeepFramework.LambdaHandler(Handler);\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">1.

Actually, a lot of additional operations happen before the .zip file is created. To name few:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS Lambda performs better when the uploaded codebase is smaller. Since we provide both local development capabilities and one-step push to production, our process optimizes resources before deploying to AWS.</li>\n<li>ES6 is not supported by node.js v0.10.x that currently runs in AWS Lambda. We compile .es6 files into ES5 compliant .js files using babel.</li>\n<li>Dependencies that are defined in package.json are automatically pulled and fine tuned for node.js v0.10.x to provide best performance possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">First, you will need the following pre-requisites:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS Account (learn how to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WviHsoz8yHk\">Create an Amazon Web Services Account</a>)</li>\n<li>AWS CLI (learn how to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html\">Configure AWS Command Line Interface</a>)</li>\n<li>Git v2+ (learn how to <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Get Started — Installing Git</a>)</li>\n<li>Java / JRE v6+ (learn how to <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html\">JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Start Here</a>)</li>\n<li>Node.js v4+ (learn how to <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script\">Install nvm</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage\">Use latest node v4</a>)</li>\n<li>DEEP CLI (execute in command line: <em>npm install deepify -g</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Note: Don’t use “sudo” in step 5. Otherwise you’ll have to <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\">fix npm permissions</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Next, you will deploy the todo app using <em>deepify</em>:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li><em>deepify install github://MitocGroup/deep-microservices-todomvc ~/deep-microservices-todomvc</em></li>\n<li><em>deepify server ~/deep-microservices-todomvc</em></li>\n<li><em>deepify deploy ~/deep-microservices-todomvc</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>Note: When step 2 (deepify server) is finished, you can open in your browser <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\">http://localhost:8000</a> and enjoy the todo app running locally.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghZNn5Gjv90?list=PLPGfD-tGOl7uNDXo_eMN1odMZflYVu2n9\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3>Cleaning Up</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">There are at least half a dozen services and several dozen of resources created during <em>deepify deploy</em>. If only there was a simple command that would clean up everything when we’re done. We thought of that and created <em>deepify undeploy</em> to address this need. When you are done using todo app and want to remove web app related resources, simply execute step 4:</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><em>deepify undeploy ~/deep-microservices-todomvc</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">As you can see, we empower developers to build hassle-free cloud-native applications or platforms using microservices architecture and serverless computing. And what about security?</p>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Well, one of the biggest value propositions on AWS is out-of-the-box <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security/\">security</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/\">compliance</a>. The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design (in other words, it won’t work otherwise). We take full advantage of shared responsibility model and enforce security in every layer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Developers and applications’ end users benefit of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">AWS IAM best practices</a> through streamlined implementations of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege\">least privilege access</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#delegate-using-roles\">delegated roles instead of credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log\">integration with logging and monitoring services</a> (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Elasticsearch + Kibana). For example, developers and end users of todo app didn’t need to explicitly define any security roles (it was done by <em>deepify deploy</em>), but they can rest assured that only their instance of todo app will be using their infrastructure &amp; platform &amp; application resources.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Here below are 2 security roles (1 for back-end and 1 for front-end) that have been seamlessly generated and enforced in each layer:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\"lambda:InvokeFunction\"],\n            \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789000:function:DeepProdTodoCreate1234abcd*\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS IAM role that allows back-end invocation of AWS Lambda function (e.g. DeepProdTodoCreate1234abcd) in web application’s AWS account (e.g. 123456789000)</div>\n</div>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">{\n  \"Version\": \"2015-10-07\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"deep.todo:task:create\"],\n      \"Resource\": [\"deep.todo:task\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">DEEP role that allows front-end resource (e.g deep.todo:task) to execute action (e.g. deep.todo:task:create)</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Benchmarking</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We have been continuously benchmarking AWS Lambda for various use cases in our microapplications. After a couple of repetitive times doing similar analysis, we decided to build the benchmarking as another microapplication and reuse the ecosystem to automatically include where we needed it. The codebase is open sourced on Github:</p>\n<div class=\"external-article\">\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-benchmarking?source=post_page-----dd81719b0dff----------------------\">\n  <h5>MitocGroup/deep-microservices-benchmarking</h5>\n  <span>DEEP Benchmarking ( https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-microservices-benchmarking) is a microservice that is built on…</span>\n  <span>github.com</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Particularly, for todo app, we have performed various benchmarking analysis on AWS Lambda by tweaking different components in a specific function (e.g. function size, memory size, billable cost, etc.).

The key is to build the functions as small as possible, focusing on a simple rule of one function to achieve only one task. Over time, these functions might grow in size, therefore we always keep an eye on them and refactor / split into the lowest possible logical denominator (smallest task).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Using the benchmarking tool, we ran multiple scenarios on the same function from todo app:</p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<th>Function Size (MB)</th>\n<th>Memory Size (MB)</th>\n<th>Max Memory Used (MB)</th>\n<th>Avg Front-end (ms)</th>\n<th>Avg Back-end (ms)</th>\n<th>Total Calls (#)</th>\n<th>Total Billed (ms)</th>\n<th>Total Billed ($/1B)*</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">128</td>\n<td class=\"center\">34-35</td>\n<td class=\"center\">375.50</td>\n<td class=\"center\">193.67</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">2,400</td>\n<td class=\"center\">4,992</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">256</td>\n<td class=\"center\">34-37</td>\n<td class=\"center\">399.40</td>\n<td class=\"center\">153.25</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">2,000</td>\n<td class=\"center\">8,340</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">512</td>\n<td class=\"center\">33-35</td>\n<td class=\"center\">341.60</td>\n<td class=\"center\">134.32</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">1,800</td>\n<td class=\"center\">15,012</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">128</td>\n<td class=\"center\">34-49</td>\n<td class=\"center\">405.57</td>\n<td class=\"center\">223.82</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">27,300</td>\n<td class=\"center\">56,784</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">256</td>\n<td class=\"center\">28-48</td>\n<td class=\"center\">354.75</td>\n<td class=\"center\">177.91</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">23,800</td>\n<td class=\"center\">99,246</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">1.1</td>\n<td class=\"center\">512</td>\n<td class=\"center\">32-47</td>\n<td class=\"center\">345.92</td>\n<td class=\"center\">163.17</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">23,100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">192,654</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">128</td>\n<td class=\"center\">49-50</td>\n<td class=\"center\">543.00</td>\n<td class=\"center\">284.03</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">3,400</td>\n<td class=\"center\">7,072</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">256</td>\n<td class=\"center\">49-50</td>\n<td class=\"center\">339.80</td>\n<td class=\"center\">153.13</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">2,100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">8,757</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">512</td>\n<td class=\"center\">49-50</td>\n<td class=\"center\">342.60</td>\n<td class=\"center\">141.02</td>\n<td class=\"center\">10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">2,000</td>\n<td class=\"center\">16,680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">128</td>\n<td class=\"center\">83-87</td>\n<td class=\"center\">416.10</td>\n<td class=\"center\">220.91</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">26,900</td>\n<td class=\"center\">55,952</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">256</td>\n<td class=\"center\">50-71</td>\n<td class=\"center\">377.69</td>\n<td class=\"center\">194.22</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">25,600</td>\n<td class=\"center\">106,752</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">55.8</td>\n<td class=\"center\">512</td>\n<td class=\"center\">57-81</td>\n<td class=\"center\">353.46</td>\n<td class=\"center\">174.65</td>\n<td class=\"center\">100</td>\n<td class=\"center\">23,300</td>\n<td class=\"center\">194,322</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n  <div class=\"center img-description\">Key performance indicators that helps decide how to fine tune the web application (* 1B = 1 Billion)</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Based on performance data, we have learned pretty cool stuff:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>The smaller the function is, the better it performs;

application in our case uses 14 different services from AWS. Also, Amazon CloudSearch is a much better fit as a serverless option for full-text search capabilities, but we prefer Elasticsearch technology and Amazon Elasticsearch Service instead</code></em></p>\n<h3>Pre-requisites and Initial Considerations</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The blue-green deployment for serverless powered applications is happening entirely on the front-end tier, mainly because all other resources from back-end, data, monitoring and security tiers are duplicated and therefore are NOT altered during this process. So, going forward, we’ll be describing only the changes that will be applied to Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 during any serverless blue-green deployment.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The simplest and most straight-forward approach to blue-green deployments for serverless powered applications is to switch all traffic from blue environment to green environment on DNS level (and in case of failures, rollback from green environment to blue environment).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Managing DNS records can be sometimes very tricky, mainly because the propagation might take unpredictable time due to various caching layers on Internet. But our experience with Amazon Route53 is amazing, as long as we are using A alias records instead of CNAME records. Here below are 3 screenshots from AWS Management Console that shows how we’ve setup <em>www1.adtechmedia.io</em> in Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3:</p>\n<div class=\"maxHeight500px center padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/edit-record-set.png\" alt=\"edit-record-set\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/get-distribution.png\" alt=\"get-distribution\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws cloudfront get-distribution --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/stati-webhosting.png\" alt=\"static-webhosting\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws s3 website s3://www1.adtechmedia.io/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Blue/Green Deployments v1</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">At this point, we are ready to switch from blue environment to green environment with zero downtime and low risks. The switch is quite simple:</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Update CloudFront distribution for blue environment by removing <em>www1.adtechmedia.io</em> from Alternative Domain Names (CNAMEs)</p>\n<div class=\"\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/step1.png\" alt=\"step1\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file://distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Update CloudFront distribution for green environment by adding <em>www1.adtechmedia.io</em> to Alternative Domain Names (CNAMEs)</p>\n<div class=\"\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/step2.png\" alt=\"step2\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file://distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Update Route53 A alias record with CloudFront distribution Domain Name from green environment</p>\n<div class=\"maxHeight500px center\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/step3.png\" alt=\"step3\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file://resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">If, for some unexpected reason, your green environment starts generating high level of failures, the rollback process is pretty similar to the one described above:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Remove CNAME from green environment</li>\n<li>Add CNAME to blue environment</li>\n<li>Update Amazon Route53 with blue environment Domain Name</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>UPDATE on 11/03/2016: A friend pointed out that it’s not necessarily to add/remove CNAMEs (which could take up to 20 minutes to propagate). Instead, just leave blue environment as it is (e.g. www1.adtechmedia.io) and setup wild carded CNAME on green environment (e.g. *.adtechmedia.io). When both distributions are enabled, blue will take precedence over green, making sure you’re not stuck with new deploy in case of high level of failures.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blue/Green Deployments v2</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">As you have seen in the previous blue-green deployments process the traffic between environments is switched suddenly, at 100% capacity. This is great for zero downtime, but if your application starts to fail, all of your users are affected. Some modern continuous deployment technics promote a more gradual switch of the traffic between environments. For example, we push only 5% of requests to green environment, while 95% still goes to blue environment. This allows to detect production problems early and on a much smaller audience of users, problems that have never surfaced in testing and staging phases. Is it possible to enable such an approach for serverless powered applications?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Short answer, yes! We’re very excited and humble to be able to explain our serverless solution, but there are some additional pre-requisites that must happen before. Let’s describe the challenge first, and then jump into our implementation and pre-requisites.</p>\n<h4>The Challenge</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Amazon CloudFront, the way it is designed, doesn’t allow same CNAME on multiple distributions. That is also the reason why we’re removing it from the blue environment and adding it to the green environment in our previous implementation.</p>\n<h4>Our implementation</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Amazon Route53 allows weighted routing of the traffic across multiple Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon S3 static websites and other endpoints. So, instead of load balancing requests between distributions, we are changing current A alias record that points to blue environment from simple routing to weighted routing, and add another A alias record as green environment that points directly to Amazon S3 static website endpoint. This enables us to manipulate requests across environments as we wish: 95% vs 5% (as shown in the screenshot below), then (if everything is fine) 90% vs 10%, and so on until blue is 0% and green is 100%.</p>\n<div class=\"maxHeight500px center\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2016-10-20/hosted-zone-id.png\" alt=\"hosted-zone-id\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n        aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file://resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">All changes are made on Amazon Route53 level, without altering Amazon CloudFront or Amazon S3 resources. And compared to previous blue-green deployment, rollback process is even faster and easier. We remove A alias record of green environment and we’re done! Well, almost done… For consistency and cost saving purposes, we also revert back A alias record of blue environment from weighted routing to simple routing.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">What are the down sizes (pre-requisites) of the blue-green deployments v2?</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Amazon S3 static website hosting doesn’t support SSL, so we find ourselves temporarily enforcing HTTP-only during blue-green deployment</li>\n<li>Amazon S3 static endpoint can be used with Amazon Route53 A alias only if the bucket name is the same with the domain name (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.adtechmedia.io\">www.adtechmedia.io</a>)</li>\n<li>Depends on the traffic size, specifically how much TPS you’re consuming, Amazon S3 might start throttling you (more details here: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html\">Request Rate and Performance Considerations</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet that would work perfectly for any serverless powered applications on AWS. As with any software, it’s up to us (developers or devops engineers) to decide the right process that fits specific use case. We just wanted to share two different approaches that empowered us to provide high quality at scale without compromising on resources and costs (which, by the way, are ridiculously low, but that’s another blogpost).</p>\n<div class=\"center img-description\">\n        <a href=\"https://blog.mitocgroup.com/mitoc-group-featured-as-frameworks-partner-by-aws-lambda-team-a7d3d5632cf8\">\n        https://blog.mitocgroup.com/mitoc-group-featured-as-frameworks-partner-by-aws-lambda-team-a7d3d5632cf8</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Last, but not the least, <a href=\"https://www.mitocgroup.com/\">Mitoc Group</a> is a technology company that focuses on innovative enterprise solutions.

They continue to work hard and serve customers with passion and integrity. Let’s take a moment to celebrate the team who made it possible.</p>\n<h3>AlexanderC</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Main contributor with over 1M lines of written code, <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexanderC\">Alex</a> was and forever will be the “father” of deep-framework. When we first met, he was a hardcore PHP guy who just couldn’t shut up about how great Symfony Framework is. We built couple of projects using Symfony and we were happy that customers love us. By that time, AWS Lambda was released in beta and our desire to manage servers started to go down exponentially. His insane curiosity and crazy desire to have Symfony as part of Lambda put us on a path to build JavaScript driven framework for Cloud Native Web Applications on AWS.</p>\n<h3>MGoria</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">From the beginning and without formal training, <a href=\"https://github.com/mgoria\">Marcel</a> defined himself as a security engineer, working on making deep-framework feasible and secure environment. For a long time he felt that his work is not exciting nor rewarding, but the fact that none of our customers ever complained about security issues, as well as every security audit was passed with success from the first attempt says the world about Marcel. But the most important fact about him is his sense of humor and extraordinary ability to emphasize the fun out of everything.</p>\n<h3>CCristi</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In his first job ever as an engineer, <a href=\"https://github.com/CCristi\">Cristi</a> blown away everybody’s minds and expectations. His ability to take a problem and turn it into working code impressed us all. But that is not a surprise, since his entire time in school he participated at national and international contests in Math and Computer Science. Cristi was always focused on winning, and nowadays as a college student he is winning with deep-framework.</p>\n<h3>DDimitrioglo</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">One of the most meticulous engineers out there, <a href=\"https://github.com/ddimitrioglo\">Dmitri</a> fixed the most annoying bugs in deep-framework. His ability to break down a problem into microsteps and reverse engineer them around helped entire team to address issues that most of us couldn’t. Dima is the core engineer and main interface between this open source project and customers needs. We are proud and happy to have him on the team, and he definitely deserves our recognition.</p>\n<h3>And More</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We’d like to thank all of deep-framework contributors:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AScripnic\">AScripnic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dragosh1011\">dragosh1011</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dsasov\">dsasov</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eistrati\">eistrati</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Everybody deserves a piece of recognition no matter how big or how small it is. We value our people and we thank them for their hard work!</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Everybody deserves a piece of recognition no matter how big or how small it is. We value our people and we thank them for their hard work!</p>\n<h3>P. S. What’s Up With This Title?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">If you got to this paragraph, you might be thinking “Well, I get it, but what’s up with this title?” If you do, here is the explanation — Mitoc Group’s deep-framework has been listed by <a href=\"https://cncf.io/\">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> as <a href=\"https://landscape.cncf.io/cncf=no\">Non-CNCF Member Products/Projects</a>. Here is the link: <a href=\"https://landscape.cncf.io/selected=mitoc-group-deep\">https://landscape.cncf.io/selected=mitoc-group-deep</a></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Since the team was not that excited about this achievement, as well as some of us were really upset for not getting more, we thought to combine the “recognition part” with “you get what you get and you don’t get upset”. We want more because we are humans and that’s fine, but remember what you are teaching kids and don’t forget that the same principles apply to yourself.</p>"},"aws-lambda-to-redshift-connection-using-iam-authentication-and-nat-gateway":{"Featured":"0","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

Recently I was required to implement a solution that involves connecting AWS Lambda to Amazon Redshift. If Amazon VPC is not in scope, feel free to stop reading here and ignore the rest of this article.</p>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">During implementation, I had to overcome the following challenges:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS Lambda’s python runtime doesn’t support natively libpq.so which is required by psycopg2 library to connect to Amazon Redshift;</li>\n<li>Securely storing and rotating Amazon Redshift’s credentials was becoming another full time project;</li>\n<li>IAM authentication for Amazon Redshift is amazing, but it took me a while to get it functional in Amazon VPC.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">For the sake of simplicity, I’ve reduced the python code used in AWS Lambda function to the minimum, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"py language-py\">import os\nimport psycopg2\nimport sys\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n  REDSHIFT_DATABASE = os.environ['REDSHIFT_DATABASE']\n  REDSHIFT_USER = os.environ['REDSHIFT_USER']\n  REDSHIFT_PASSWD = os.environ['REDSHIFT_PASSWD']\n  REDSHIFT_PORT = os.environ['REDSHIFT_PORT']\n  REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT = os.environ['REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT']\n  REDSHIFT_QUERY = \"SELECT DISTINCT tablename FROM pg_table_def WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename\"\n\n  try:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n      dbname=REDSHIFT_DATABASE,\n      user=REDSHIFT_USER,\n      password=REDSHIFT_PASSWD,\n      port=REDSHIFT_PORT,\n      host=REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT)\n  except Exception as ERROR:\n    print(\"Connection Issue: \" + ERROR)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n  try:\n    cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n    print(cursor.execute(REDSHIFT_QUERY))\n    cursor.close()\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n  except Exception as ERROR:\n    print(\"Execution Issue: \" + ERROR)\n    sys.exit(1)\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Issue #1</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">If you develop on Mac OSX or Windows, the local version of psycopg2 library most probably is not compatible with AWS Lambda python3.6 runtime. I got the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>No module named 'psycopg2._psycopg': ModuleNotFoundError\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This is an easy and quick fix. Either you’re compiling psycopg2 library on an Amazon Linux compatible operating system. Or, a much better alternative, use the following GitHub repository:</p>\n<div class=\"external-article\">\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2?source=post_page-----b40c6002082b----------------------\">\n  <h5>jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2</h5>\n  <span>Contribute to awslambda-psycopg2 development by creating an account on GitHub.</span>\n    <span>github.com</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<h4>Issue #2</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Lambda provides environment variables capability, which allows developers to decouple fixed components of the code from variable ones. Since our team manages most of our cloud resources using Terraform, here below is the simplified version Terraform script for Lambda function:</p>\n<pre><code>resource \"aws_lambda_function\" \"lambda_function\" {\n  s3_bucket        = \"${var.lambda_source_bucket}\"\n  s3_key           = \"${var.lambda_source_file}\"\n\n  source_code_hash = \"${base64sha256(file(var.lambda_source_file))}\"\n  function_name    = \"${var.lambda_function_name}\"\n  handler          = \"${var.lambda_function_handler}\"\n  runtime          = \"${var.lambda_function_runtime}\"\n  timeout          = \"${var.lambda_function_timeout}\"\n  role             = \"${var.lambda_iam_role}\"\n\n  vpc_config {\n    security_group_ids = [\"${split(\",\", var.lambda_security_group_ids)}\"]\n    subnet_ids         = [\"${split(\",\", var.lambda_vpc_subnet_ids)}\"]\n  }\n\n  environment {\n    variables = {\n      REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT = \"${var.redshift_connection[\"endpoint\"]}\"\n      REDSHIFT_PORT     = \"${var.redshift_connection[\"port\"]}\"\n      REDSHIFT_USER     = \"${var.redshift_connection[\"username\"]}\"\n      REDSHIFT_PASSWD   = \"${var.redshift_connection[\"password\"]}\"\n      REDSHIFT_DATABASE = \"${var.redshift_connection[\"database\"]}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Now, everything related to Amazon Redshift connection is concentrated in <em>redshift_connection</em> variable, which stores values in plain text. To overcome this security problem, we have to consider one of the following solutions:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/\">AWS Key Management Service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/\">AWS Systems Manager’s Parameter Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-authentication-access-control.html\">IAM Authentication for Amazon Redshift</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Using KMS or Parameter Store is definitely a viable solution, but I opted to the most natural choice and less maintenance effort down the road: the native integration between Redshift and IAM. Shortly, with an API call, Redshift issues temporary credentials based on IAM permissions which can be used for Redshift connections. Now my Lambda function looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"py language-py\">import os\nimport boto3\nimport psycopg2\nimport sys\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n  REDSHIFT_DATABASE = os.environ['REDSHIFT_DATABASE']\n  REDSHIFT_USER = os.environ['REDSHIFT_USER']\n  REDSHIFT_PASSWD = os.environ['REDSHIFT_PASSWD']\n  REDSHIFT_PORT = os.environ['REDSHIFT_PORT']\n  REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT = os.environ['REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT']\n  REDSHIFT_CLUSTER = os.environ['REDSHIFT_CLUSTER']\n  REDSHIFT_QUERY = \"SELECT DISTINCT tablename FROM pg_table_def WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename\"\n\n  try:\n    client = boto3.client('redshift')\n    creds = client.get_cluster_credentials(\n      DbUser=REDSHIFT_USER,\n      DbName=REDSHIFT_DATABASE,\n      ClusterIdentifier=REDSHIFT_CLUSTER,\n      DurationSeconds=3600)\n  except Exception as ERROR:\n    print(\"Credentials Issue: \" + ERROR)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n  try:\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\n      dbname=REDSHIFT_DATABASE,\n      user=creds['DbUser'],\n      password=creds['DbPassword'],\n      port=REDSHIFT_PORT,\n      host=REDSHIFT_ENDPOINT)\n  except Exception as ERROR:\n    print(\"Connection Issue: \" + ERROR)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n  try:\n    cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n    print(cursor.execute(REDSHIFT_QUERY))\n    cursor.close()\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n  except Exception as ERROR:\n    print(\"Execution Issue: \" + ERROR)\n    sys.exit(1)\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Issue #3</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The most time consuming, as well as the most interesting challenge to address was Lambda function timeout. Turns out that switching to Redshift temporary credentials, you need AWS Lambda to be able to access Redshift APIs that are not available by default in your VPC. The options are to route either through ENI or through NAT. I opted for NAT gateway solution that is summarized here below using the following Terraform script:</p>\n<pre><code>data \"aws_security_group\" \"security_group\" {\n  id = \"${join(\"\",slice(var.lambda_security_group_ids,0,1))}\"\n}\n\ndata \"aws_subnet_ids\" \"lambda_subnets\" {\n  vpc_id = \"${data.aws_security_group.security_group.vpc_id}\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_eip\" \"nat\" {\n  vpc = true\n}\n\nresource \"aws_nat_gateway\" \"lambda_gateway\" {\n  allocation_id = \"${aws_eip.nat.id}\"\n  subnet_id     = \"${join(\"\",slice(data.aws_subnet_ids.lambda_subnets.ids,0,1))}\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_route_table\" \"lambda_private\" {\n  vpc_id = \"${data.aws_security_group.security_group.vpc_id}\"\n\n  route {\n    cidr_block = \"0.0.0.0/0\"\n    nat_gateway_id = \"${aws_nat_gateway.lambda_gateway.id}\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_route_table_association\" \"lambda_private\" {\n  subnet_id      = \"${join(\"\",slice(data.aws_subnet_ids.lambda_subnets.ids,1,2))}\"\n  route_table_id = \"${aws_route_table.lambda_private.id}\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">I would argue that, at the time of blog post writing, this is the ideal solution to connect AWS Lambda with Amazon Redshift running in Amazon VPC. If you use python3.6 runtime, consider <a href=\"https://github.com/jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2\">awslambda-psycopg2</a> repository. Next, replace regular postgres driver connection with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-authentication-access-control.html\">IAM authentication</a>. Finally, enable <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/\">outside VPC access</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"introducing-programmatic-aws-landing-zone-as-terraform-module":{"Featured":"0","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

In other words — quoting our friends from AWS — our customers are reinventing themselves on AWS. It is a never ending effort to invent and simplify on behalf of customers, and AWS is doing a great job at solving complex problems with easy to digest solutions.</p>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-06-18/aws-arch.png\" alt=\"AWS Landing Zone\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS Landing Zone (source:\n       <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone\" target=\"_blank\">https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone</a>)\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h3>What is AWS Landing Zone?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Quoting from official source:</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and <strong>require a deep understanding of AWS services.</strong></em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The AWS Landing Zone solution reduced by a lot the complexity and the consistency of similar design patterns provided to different customers. On the other hand, our team had to rebuild some CloudFormation components as Terraform components, in order to use them further down the automation pipeline.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">So we asked ourselves: Why not to build the entire AWS Landing Zone solution in Terraform? Would that be feasible and would that solve our customers problems? Spoiler alert: It is and it does :)</p>\n<h3>When NOT to Use AWS Landing Zone?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">If you are managing your cloud services and cloud resources within one or two AWS accounts, this solution might be an overkill for you. Everybody else, please continue reading :)</p>\n<h3>What to Consider Before Getting Started?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Many large organizations we have worked with do have some kind of cloud strategy already in place. Without a clear vision and clear expectations, companies struggle to adopt cloud services successfully. Please consider spending some time in order to define your own cloud strategy and how does AWS fit into that strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Once the strategy is in place, successful AWS Landing Zone customers have considered proactively the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>Automation is NOT an option. Cloud native automation is preferred.</li>\n<li>Teams are consistently using the same pipelines with the same toolset for cloud resources provisioning. Terraform is preferred.</li>\n<li>Cloud champions are empowered to build reusable processes and expose them as reusable services instead of reusable code. Serverless architecture is preferred.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Introducing Terraform Module for AWS Landing Zone</h3>\n<div class=\"external-article\">\n  <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone/aws?source=post_page-----3e566ee6e73f----------------------\">\n  <h5>Terraform Module Registry: AWS Landing Zone</h5>\n  <span>\n    AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. This repository contains one terraform module that dynamically deploys components of AWS Landing Zone solution based on input list of .tfvars files.\n  </span>\n    <span>registry.terraform.io</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">After a couple of months of hard work, it is my pleasure to introduce terraform module for AWS Landing Zone (see above link). <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone\">Source code</a> is managed using GitHub and <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone\">stable releases</a> are published on Terraform Module Registry.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">To get started, simply include <code>main.tf</code> into your terraform codebase:</p>\n<pre><code>module \"landing_zone\" {\n  source     = \"TerraHubCorp/landing-zone/aws\"\n  version    = \"0.0.6\"\n  root_path  = \"${path.module}\"\n  account_id = \"${var.account_id}\"\n  region     = \"${var.region}\"\n  landing_zone_components = \"${var.landing_zone_components}\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">NOTE: Make sure to include <code>variables.tf</code> and whatever makes sense from <code>outputs.tf</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">To simplify and make it easier to understand, we included default values in <code>terraform.tfvars</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>account_id = \"123456789012\"\nregion = \"us-east-1\"\nlanding_zone_components = {\n  landing_zone_pipeline_s3_bucket = \"s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/landing_zone_pipeline_s3_bucket/default.tfvars\"\n  [...]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This means that when you use this terraform module, you will need to:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Change <code>account_id</code> and <code>region</code> to values that correspond to your AWS Organization</li>\n<li>Change <code>landing_zone_components</code> to values that fit into your AWS Landing Zone use case</li>\n<li>Change <code>s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany</code> to your S3 bucket and S3 key prefix where you will be storing <code>.tfvars</code> files (or absolute path to <code>.tfvars</code> files on local disk)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This module can have tens, hundreds or thousands of deployable components, but not all of them should be and will be deployed. At runtime, components that are not part of <code>landing_zone_components</code> map variable will be ignored.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">We are very excited and proud of sharing some fruits of our continuous effort to help customers build cloud native automation. Terraform module for AWS Landing Zone is just another solution that helps organizations more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. We are well aware that AWS evolves with an insanely fast pace, and we are committed to evolve this terraform powered solution that covers all the basics, as well as integrates with other successful solutions on AWS.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"three-success-stories-of-aws-landing-zone-business-overview":{"Featured":"0","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

These large organizations generate billions of dollars in yearly revenue and, implicitly, come with high level of complexity on AWS. There are lots of challenges and use cases, most of them are pretty common, but also enough of them that are pretty unique. We will provide only a business overview, while the technical overview will be described in a future article.</p>\n<h3>What Does AWS Landing Zone Solution Do?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and require a deep understanding of AWS services.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This solution can help save time by automating the set-up of an environment for running secure and scalable workloads while implementing an initial security baseline through the creation of core accounts and resources. It also provides a baseline environment to get started with a multi-account architecture, identity and access management, governance, data security, network design, and logging.</p>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-06-19/aws-lz.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS Landing Zone Architecture (source:\n       <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/\" target=\"_blank\">https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/</a>)\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The AWS Landing Zone solution includes 4 basic AWS accounts: (1) AWS Organization Account, (2) Shared Services Account, (3) Log Archive Account and (4) Security Account. This solution also integrates into add-on products that can be deployed using the AWS Service Catalog such as AWS Managed AD and Directory Connector for AWS Single Sign-On (SSO).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The AWS Landing Zone solution also deploys an AWS Account Vending Machine (AVM) product for provisioning and automatically configuring new AWS accounts. The AVM leverages AWS SSO for managing user account access. This environment is customizable to allow customers to implement their own account baselines through a Landing Zone configuration.</p>\n<h3>Why Is AWS Landing Zone Solution So Successful?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In order to dive deep and understand how <a href=\"https://blog.mitocgroup.com/introducing-programmatic-aws-landing-zone-as-terraform-module-3e566ee6e73f\">Terraform Module for AWS Landing Zone</a> helps, we decided to put on our customers hats and tell customers stories through their experiences. For simplicity and respect for their privacy, we will not be disclosing their names and we will not be providing any private information.</p>\n<h4>Customer #1</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Large media and entertainment company, with business presence and technical operations all over the world, customer #1 adopted cloud first strategy and required help to setup multi-account approach on AWS cloud using github, concourse and terraform. Their strategy directed cloud operations team to build out couple of dozens of AWS accounts as extension to their existing data centers and provide the same level of security and compliance as on-prem.</p>\n<h4>Customer #2</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Large content analytics company, with technical teams in US, EU and India, customer #2 decided to migrate and fully transform themselves on AWS. The multi-year migration effort resulted in hundreds of applications running of several thousands of servers to be rehosted / refactored / revised / rebuilt / replaced. Their entire IT footprint ended up running on over fifty AWS accounts with four members of centralized cloud operations team using github, jenkins and terraform.</p>\n<h4>Customer #3</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Large insurance company, with global presence in and highly regulated by almost every country in the world, customer #3 continues its multi-year cloud journey. With hundreds of AWS accounts, various business units are moving slowly and incrementally parts of IT footprint to AWS by provisioning cloud resources as extensions to their on-prem data centers. Cloud operations teams use bitbucket, bamboo and terraform to manage and operate on AWS.</p>\n<h4>Common Denominators</h4>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>VCS —Overwhelming majority of enterprise organizations use some kind of Version Control System, either we are talking about github, bitbucket or others. Not in scope for now, so I’ll skip this part.</li>\n<li>CI/CD — Cloud providers empowered many large companies to adopt some kind of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Deployment). Not in scope for now, so I’ll skip this as well.</li>\n<li>Terraform — It doesn’t come anymore as a surprise that lots of enterprise customers with large IT footprints are using terraform to provision cloud resources, therefore I’ll skip this part.</li>\n<li>(Lots of) AWS accounts — No matter how many cloud accounts (to be read: several, dozens or even hundreds), customers want to follow best practices recommended by cloud providers that ideally are consistent with their existing policies / procedures and, why not, even improve their operations by making them better and more secure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Multi-Account Strategy</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Why are customers opting into multi-account strategy? First, although customers can clearly separate users / data / environments using IAM, VPC, SG and STS, single-account strategy requires a vast amount of management and cost allocation that is usually not feasible. Second, if you plan to acquire other companies, integrating into single-account strategy is very expensive. Therefore, it’s a non starter.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this context, the allocation of AWS accounts are usually decided by:</p>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>Business Unit (or some other kind of legal organizational breakdown)</li>\n<li>Geographical Location (or some other kind of territorial breakdown)</li>\n<li>Production vs Non-Production (or some other kind of environment / SDLC breakdown)</li>\n<li>Shared Services (use cases that are shared or can’t / shouldn’t be isolated)</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>NOTE: All of our customers, including Customer #1, Customer #2 and Customer #3 followed this best practice as part of their multi-account strategy.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Multi-account strategy doesn’t stop just at multiple AWS accounts. The goal of AWS Landing Zone is to have a minimal baseline setup for security, operations and management functions. For example, Customer #1 decided to include in the baseline only Centralized Billing, 3rd party SSO and AWS Direct Connect. Customer #2 and Customer #3 decided to, additionally, add Centralized Logging solution and Centralized Security solution. Some solutions were cloud native services on AWS like Cloudtrail, Managed AD and SSO, others not so native — Splunk, SignalFX, CloudCheckr and PingIdentity.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">To go one step further, some customers adopt AVM (Account Vending Machine) to provision new AWS accounts and deploy the baseline into those accounts as well. In our experience, neither Customer #1, Customer #2, nor Customer #3 opted into using this solution. Instead, they use Service Catalog to allow existing / predefined AWS accounts to use only AWS products vetted and whitelisted by their organizations.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">At the end of the day, either AWS accounts are created manually or automatically, customers decide what goes into the baseline and how the provisioning and deployment of AWS Landing Zone components are done (spoiler alert: auto-magically). This is the real value of successful AWS Landing Zone implementation.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this article, we tried to describe important business aspects of successfully adopting AWS Landing Zone. We talked about 3 different customers without disclosing their names and any private information. These large organizations generate billions of dollars in yearly revenue and, implicitly, come with high level of complexity on AWS. We intentionally stopped short on the technical side of this solution because we will be covering that next (link coming soon).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"aws-landing-zone-module-now-supports-terraform-v0-12":{"Featured":"0","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

Today we are excited to announce that current implementation supports both v0.11 and below, as well as v0.12 and above.</p>\n<h3>What Changed?</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Additionally to Terraform syntax change from HCL1 to HCL2, we refactored components related convertor to switch from YAML to HCL instead of JSON. This feature allows easier debugging and fixing of Terraform related issues and remove any potential problems associated with conversion from one format into another.\nThe flexibility of passing a dynamic number of components as input variables is managed by several python scripts. We rewrote these supporting python scripts into nodejs scripts, therefore removing extra dependencies and simplifying this terraform module.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">But the most important improvement that we were able to achieve, with the help from the open source community, is to publish a <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/ROADMAP.md\">high level roadmap</a>. It gives an overview of how much effort it took so far and how much more effort it will take to add 3rd party support that goes beyond standard AWS offering.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Terraform Module for AWS Landing Zone is fully functional, supporting both Terraform v0.11 and below, as well as Terraform v0.12 and above. Latest version is published on Terraform Module Registry: <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone\">https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone</a></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"my-architecture-apache-kafka-by-confluent-on-aws-cloud":{"Featured":"0","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

Each region was using 3 availability zones for HA and Low Latency. Kafka nodes require sub 10ms latency, therefore different clusters were deployed in each region and messages are being transferred from one region into another using Replicator nodes (to be precise: Replicator processes are running on Connector nodes).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Each Kafka cluster includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>5 Brokers nodes</li>\n<li>5 Zookeeper nodes</li>\n<li>2 Connector nodes (+2 Replicator processes)</li>\n<li>2 Schema Registry nodes</li>\n<li>2 REST API nodes</li>\n<li>2 KSQL nodes</li>\n<li>2 KStream nodes</li>\n<li>1 Control Center node</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Traffic between customer datacenters and AWS regions, as well as from one AWS region into another AWS region, is managed through Transit Gateway.

We will start with reference architecture (see picture below) for AWS Landing Zone solution and dive deeper into each customer’s customization that make their solutions both unique and reusable.</p>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-08-02/aws-lz-arch.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">\n      AWS Landing Zone Architecture (source:\n      <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone\">https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone</a>)\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">First step is to include terraform module <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/TerraHubCorp/landing-zone\">for AWS Landing Zone into your</a> code base. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>module \"landing_zone\" {\n  source                  = \"./modules/landing_zone\"\n  root_path               = path.module\n  landing_zone_providers  = {\n    default = {\n      account_id = \"123456789012\"\n      region     = \"us-east-1\"\n    }\n    [...]\n  }\n  landing_zone_components = {\n    landing_zone_vpc = \"s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/landing_zone_vpc/default.tfvars\"\n    [...]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>NOTE: Placeholder […] from above is used to suggest that similar syntax can be added. Remove it or update in order to have valid HCL format.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Definition of <code>landing_zone_providers</code> and <code>landing_zone_components</code> allow flexible and consistent provisioning of AWS resources across multiple AWS accounts and/or AWS regions. Similar to microservices architecture, customers of this terraform module are encouraged to define one terraform resource per one landing zone component.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">For simplicity, we moved both arguments <code>landing_zone_providers</code> and <code>landing_zone_components</code> into variables. We are manipulating them at runtime by supplying customized <code>terraform.tfvars</code>. In this case, our terraform module reference becomes simple and immutable:</p>\n<pre><code>module \"landing_zone\" {\n  source                  = \"./modules/landing_zone\"\n  root_path               = path.module\n  landing_zone_providers  = var.landing_zone_providers\n  landing_zone_components = var.landing_zone_components\n}\nvariable \"landing_zone_providers\" {\n  type = map(map(string))\n}\nvariable \"landing_zone_components\" {\n  type = map(string)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">VERY IMPORTANT: You can define lots of providers and include tons of components, but only the ones referenced in associated .tfvars files will be provisioned / deployed by terraform module.</p>\n<h3>Common Components</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The following components are pretty common across our customers:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS Organization (referenced <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/terraform.tfvars#L22:L26\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>AWS Service Catalog</li>\n<li>AWS IAM, including Identity Providers; excluding AWS SSO</li>\n<li>Amazon VPC, including Subnets, Routes, Gateways, NACLs, Security Groups, Peering or Direct Connect (referenced <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/terraform.tfvars#L27:L40\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">As you can see from above mentioned references, the demo <code>.tfvars</code> files are stored in <code>s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/[component_name]/default.tfvars</code> (publicly available). The goal is to provide reusable structure of immutable configurations that can consistently provision / deploy terraform resources (to be read: AWS resources) across multiple terraform providers (to be read: AWS accounts and/or AWS regions) without any need to make changes to landing zone components. Only <code>.tfvars</code> are changed over time.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">But more importantly, we can use the same S3 bucket (or create one bucket per customer) and assign IAM temporary credentials (or cross account role) for each customer without exposing private information stored in <code>.tfvars</code> files. Every execution of terraform module can clearly delimit IAM credentials (or roles) for where <code>.tfvars</code> files are located, where <code>.tfstate</code> files are stored as backend and/or where AWS resources are provisioned / deployed.</p>\n<h3>Unique Components</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Unique components are only unique on architecture diagram, while in reality all components are executed the same, meaning terraform configurations are open source and publicly available, while <code>.tfvars</code> files are private and pretty unique to every customer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">And, to be clear, not all landing zone components were creating AWS resources from scratch. For example, some customers already had VPCs or IAMs. In these cases, we used <code>terraform import</code> to bring in existing AWS resources and avoid duplicated or colliding resources.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Unfortunately we don’t have written permission to disclose customers names. That is why we will be referencing them below by their revenue from last year.</p>\n<h4>Customer #1: $49B in revenue</h4>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-08-02/customer1.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this case, we worked with a customer who is using the following 3rd party services and tools that are not native to AWS:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS SSO =&gt; Office 365</li>\n<li>AWS CodePipeline =&gt; Jenkins</li>\n<li>AWS GuardDuty =&gt; SignalFX</li>\n<li>Logs =&gt; Splunk</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">As shown in the diagram on the left, terraform based implementation of AWS Landing Zone is perfectly inline with AWS best practices. By replacing AWS native solutions with similar 3 party products, we were able to combine existing solutions and AWS cloud in perfect harmony.</p>\n<h4>Customer #2: $33B in revenue</h4>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-08-02/customer2.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this case, we worked with a customer who is using the following 3rd party services and tools that are not native to AWS:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS SSO =&gt; Ping Identity</li>\n<li>AWS CodePipeline =&gt; Bamboo</li>\n<li>Amazon S3 =&gt; Bitbucket</li>\n<li>AWS Parameter Store =&gt; Vault</li>\n<li>AWS GuardDuty =&gt; Alert Logic</li>\n<li>Logs =&gt; Datadog</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Similar to previous customer, the diagram on the left reflects a sustainable customization of AWS Landing Zone solution where some native components to AWS are being replaced with existing comparable 3rd party solutions.</p>\n<h4>Customer #3: $11B in revenue</h4>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-08-02/customer3.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this case, we worked with a customer who is using the following 3rd party services and tools that are not native to AWS:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>AWS SSO =&gt; SiteMinder</li>\n<li>AWS CodePipeline =&gt; TravisCI</li>\n<li>Amazon S3 =&gt; GitHub</li>\n<li>AWS GuardDuty =&gt; OSSEC + Grafana</li>\n<li>Logs =&gt; Elastic + Grafana</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Similar to previous customers, the architecture diagram on the left is a customized version of AWS Landing Zone diagram with several AWS native solutions replace with similar 3rd party services or tools that customer already uses in their organization.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<ol class=\"graf graf-ol-li graf-grap\">\n<li>This terraform module accepts arguments landing<em>zone</em>providers and landing<em>zone</em>components among others</li>\n<li>Providers and components can be as many as you want; Only the ones referenced in .tfvars files will be provisioned / deployed</li>\n<li>Ideally the code for landing zone components is immutable, while .tfvars files are adjustable over time</li>\n<li>Microservices architecture is highly recommended, aim for one terraform resource per one landing zone component</li>\n<li>Use terraform import for existing AWS resources to avoid duplication or collisions with landing zone components</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">In this article, we tried to describe relevant level of details associated with technical implementation of AWS Landing Zone solution using terraform module. We talked about 3 different customers without disclosing their names and any private information. Component based immutable terraform configurations with adjustable <code>.tfvars</code> files allowed advanced flexibility and reliable consistency across multiple AWS accounts using AWS best practices.</p>"},"my-architecture-aws-control-tower-vs-aws-landing-zone":{"Featured":"1","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and require a deep understanding of AWS services.</p>\n<h3>AWS Control Tower vs AWS Landing Zone</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Although official documentation explains <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/faqs/#AWS_Solution_and_Service_Comparisons\">the difference between AWS Control Tower and AWS Landing Zone</a>, we believe that customers should learn more details about these two offerings. And keep in mind, these solutions are not apples to apples comparable, more like apples to oranges.\nAWS Landing Zone solution was launched in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/introducing-aws-landing-zone/\">June 2018</a>, while AWS Control Tower was announced in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/aws-control-tower-and-aws-security-hub-powerful-enterprise-twins/\">November 2018</a> and launched in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/06/aws-control-tower-is-now-generally-available/\">June 2019</a>. It’s not very clear why in just a couple of months AWS introduced two competing products. Based on our limited experience, we would assume AWS Landing Zone solution was very well received by enterprise customers, but in the same time required fundamental changes which led to AWS Control Tower service.\nAs of time of writing, AWS Control Tower doesn’t support existing setups for AWS Organization or AWS SSO, although official FAQ claims it will be added in the future, as well as ability to migrate from AWS Landing Zone solution to AWS Control Tower service.</p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<th>Service or Feature</th>\n<th>AWS Control Tower</th>\n<th>AWS Landing Zone</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">New AWS Organization account</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Existing AWS Organization account</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">New AWS SSO environment</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Existing AWS SSO environment</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">New AWS Service Catalog environment</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Existing AWS Service Catalog environment</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">New or Existing Security Hub environment</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Support for CI/CD</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Interactive APIs</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">CloudFormation template(s)</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<td class=\"center\">Terrafom module(s)</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x274C; no</td>\n<td class=\"center\">&#x2705; yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Therefore, in summary, which one should we use: AWS Control Tower or AWS Landing Zone? The answer is: depends. If you start from scratch or can afford destroying existing AWS resources, then AWS Control Tower is the way forward. Otherwise, consider AWS Landing Zone and fingers crossed for future migration solution from AWS Landing Zone to AWS Control Tower.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"my-architecture-private-equity-platform-on-aws-cloud":{"Featured":"4","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

This article will describe the high level architecture of a leading private equity platform on AWS cloud.","minRead":"~ 5 min read","htmlCode":"<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-10/private-equity-platform.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">Private Equity Platform on AWS Cloud</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Private Equity Sector</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Private equity industry is pretty unique in the financial world because it offers important long-term advantages, including strong historical returns and diversification benefits. From a technical perspective, public clouds are becoming very important factors to private equity firms because of speed and agility combined with better results at lower costs.\nHistorically, private equity platforms were built and deployed on-premises, primarily driven by the private nature of the industry and the need to protect the secret sauce of deal making processes. Providers like AWS and GCP have become more relevant and very important to the industry because they proved over time that you can have it both ways: private and secure, as well as faster and cheaper.</p>\n<h3>Leading Private Equity Platform</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Since we don’t have a written permission to name the brand and the product, we will refer to this platform as leading private equity platform. We hope that in the future the company behind this platform will reconsider their position and allow us to be more specific.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This leading private equity platform allows PE companies to manage:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>Investor Tracking</li>\n<li>Portfolio Management</li>\n<li>Customer Relationship Management</li>\n<li>Accounting</li>\n<li>Reporting and Auditing</li>\n<li>Batch Data Processing</li>\n<li>Business Events and Business Rules</li>\n<li>Team Security and Admin Tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reference Architecture on AWS Cloud</h3>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-10/reference-arch.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">Reference Architecture on AWS Cloud</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Our team put together the reference architecture for leading private equity platform based on best practices described in <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-web-hosting-best-practices.pdf\">Web Application Hosting in the AWS Cloud</a> white-paper and customers requirements to run it in highly available and highly scalable mode (see the picture on the left).\nCustomers / end users of leading private equity platform are connecting from personal computers, or mobile devices, or virtual desktops like Citrix and Amazon Workspaces to a DNS service called Amazon Route 53.</p>\n<h3>Networking</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Amazon Route 53’s latency based routing directs the customer to the closest AWS region (in our case, either North Virginia or Oregon) and corresponding ALB (which stands for Application Load Balancer). Reference architecture leverages 2 AWS regions and 3 AWS availability zones. The life of any chain of requests is lived in the region selected by Amazon Route 53 at the beginning and never goes across regions during its short lifetime.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">When a PE company wants to save on infrastructure costs, we help them by reducing the number of active availability zones or, sometimes, the number of active regions, which results in reduced SLAs.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The ALB from above can be either public or private. Public means that underlying subnets are connecting to the Internet directly through Amazon’s Internet Gateway. Private means that underlying subnets are connecting to the Internet through customer’s data center(s) via Direct Connect or some other Private Gateway.</p>\n<h3>Web Servers</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">This ALB proxies requests to a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances called Web Servers via port 443 (managed through WebSG security group). Each Web Server includes static components like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as dynamic components like .NET 4.5/C# and IIS 7/8 running on top of Windows Server 2008/2012. These instances are wrapped into an ASG (aka Auto Scaling Group) to provide elasticity when needed. Everything is encrypted in transit and at rest.</p>\n<h3>App Servers</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Traffic from Web Servers is directed to a second ALB that is internal. This ALB proxies requests to a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances called App Servers via port 443 (managed through AppSG security group). Each App Server works as an internal API to the platform that includes .NET 4.5/C# and IIS 7/8 running on top of Windows Server 2008/2012. These instances are wrapped into an ASG (aka Auto Scaling Group) to provide elasticity when needed. Everything is encrypted in transit and at rest.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">API functionality includes multiple layers like Web Services, Dynamic Web Forms, Business Rules and Business Events, Reporting Engine and Audit Engine, Domain Models, Data Access Objects and many others.</p>\n<h3>Database</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Traffic from App Servers is directed to Amazon RDS for SQL Server cluster which consists of master node and standby node. Only master node is available for querying, while standby node isn’t exposed until master becomes unavailable. This RDS capability is called Multi-AZ and uses SQL Server’s native Always On feature. Everything is encrypted in transit and at rest.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Running Amazon RDS for SQL Server cross region replication is still a challenge that doesn’t have a native solution yet.

Let’s dive deeper into main security components and understand some practical implications.","minRead":"~ 5 min read","htmlCode":"<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-18/terraform-module.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS Landing Zone / Terraform Module Components</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">The AWS Landing Zone solution includes an initial security baseline that can be used as a starting point for establishing and implementing a customized account security baseline for your organization. By default, the initial security baseline includes the following settings:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) &amp; Amazon VPC Flow Logs</li>\n<li>AWS CloudTrail &amp; AWS CloudTrail Logs</li>\n<li>AWS Config &amp; AWS Config Rules</li>\n<li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>\n<li>Cross-Account Access via AWS IAM</li>\n<li>AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)</li>\n<li>Amazon GuardDuty</li>\n<li>Security Notifications via Amazon SNS</li>\n<li>and more (e.g. KMS, CloudWatch, Security Hub, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Landing Zone Security Components</h3>\n<div class=\"img-post-left\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-18/terraform-module-2.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS Landing Zone / Terraform Module Components</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Last week we covered in great length of details <a href=\"https://blog.mitocgroup.com/terraform-module-components-for-aws-landing-zone-solution-c74267a0e70c\">Terraform Module Components for AWS Landing Zone Solution</a>. We <code>used landing_zone_vpc</code> component as a reference to describe what a component is and how does it work. This week we would like to dive deeper into security focused components. Specifically:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>vpc</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>subnet</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>security_group</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>cloudtrail</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>config</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>iam_role</li>\n<li>landing<em>zone</em>sso</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-18/service-mapped.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n    <div class=\"center img-description\">AWS Services Mapped to Landing Zone Security Components</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Landing Zone VPC</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS provides security capabilities and services to increase privacy and control network access. For example, Amazon VPC is offering by design built-in network firewalls that isolate AWS resources from both outside world and other inside networks.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_vpc\">Landing Zone VPC component</a> allows customers to customize these network boundaries beyond default settings. Implemented as terraform component, this piece of infrastructure as code empowers users to import existing VPCs (therefore no downtime), as well as create new VPCs that can easily replace current networks or work as an extension to existing networks.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone Subnet</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Amazon VPC allows customers to create virtual networks and divide them into subnets. VPC subnets are mapped to specific Availability Zones (AZs) and, therefore, subnet placement is one mechanism to ensure AWS resources are properly distributed across multiple data centers / different physical locations.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_subnet\">Landing Zone Subnet component</a> allows customers to specify the mapping between CIDR block(s) and AZs. As any other terraform implementation, existing subnets can be reused without downtime or created from scratch. Any future AWS resource will be using one (or multiple) subnets to be created (or updated) in any specific AZ (or AZs). This component is directly dependent on Landing Zone VPC.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone Security Group</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">A security group acts as a virtual stateful firewall that controls the traffic into specific AWS resource. This mandatory firewall is configured in a default deny-all mode and customers must explicitly open the ports needed to allow inbound traffic. Traffic can be restricted by protocol, by service port, and also by source IP address (individual IP or CIDR block) or another security group.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_security_group\">Landing Zone Security Group component</a> allows customers to pinpoint ingress and egress firewall rules. Using terraform implementation, existing rules can be imported and reused without downtime, empowering teams to provision and manage their network level firewalls as code. This component is directly dependent on Landing Zone VPC.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone CloudTrail</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing by logging every action to AWS APIs associated with your AWS account(s). With CloudTrail, you can continuously monitor and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_cloudtrail\">Landing Zone CloudTrail component</a> allows customers to centralize all logs into single storage location across all accounts linked to AWS Organization. Terraform implementation empowers users to reuse existing trails and/or existing logs without any gaps in historical data. Remember, AWS CloudTrail is not able to back-fill missing logs if turned off or mismanaged.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone Config</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Config is a service that maintains a configuration history of your AWS resources and evaluates the configuration against best practices and your internal policies. Config rules can be used to audit your use of AWS for compliance with external compliance frameworks such as the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, or with your internal security policies related to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and others.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_config\">Landing Zone Config component</a> allows customers to implement in terraform the recording and the rules needed to manage inventory and configuration of AWS resources, as well as change management to those resources over time. Terraform import can map existing AWS resources to current tfstates and tfvars, while missing recording and/or rules will be created from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone IAM Role</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables customers to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny access to AWS resources.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_iam_role\">Landing Zone IAM Role component</a> allows customers to customize access to AWS resources by managing security controls as terraform configurations. If users already have existing IAM roles, terraform will import and reuse them, otherwise they will be created from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Landing Zone SSO</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. AWS SSO supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 integrations, which extends SSO access to any potential SAML-enabled applications.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/tree/master/components/landing_zone_sso\">Landing Zone SSO component</a> allows customers to specify which AWS accounts and/or business applications will be integrated into AWS SSO. Terraform implementation empowers security engineers and teams to reuse existing setup, as well as bring new integrations into this service by using centralized infrastructure as code processes powered by terraform.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone\">Terraform module</a> for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/\">AWS Landing Zone</a> solution is delivering a promise of a stronger security. This module implements core security services and integrations that are recommended by AWS best practices, as well as industry security and compliance frameworks. As we evolve this module, we will be constantly adding new security focused components (e.g. AWS Security Hub, AWS Control Tower, AWS Transit Gateway, etc).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"},"terraform-module-components-for-aws-landing-zone-solution":{"Featured":"3","Author":"Eugene Istrati","AboutAuthor":"Proud Father.

Let’s dive deeper into what a component is and how does it work.","minRead":"~ 4 min read","htmlCode":"<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">To make sure that everybody has the same understanding about <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone#how-does-this-module-work\">Terraform Module for AWS Landing Zone</a> solution, here below is how <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/main.tf\">this module</a> looks like at the time of writing:</p>\n<div class=\"padd25px\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2019-09-13/code.png\" alt=\"partner aws\" />\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">And if we take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/terraform.tfvars\">terraform.tfvars</a>, we should see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>landing_zone_providers = {\n  default = {\n    account_id = \"123456789012\"\n    region     = \"us-east-1\"\n  }\n  [...]\n}\nlanding_zone_components = {\n  landing_zone_vpc = \"s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/landing_zone_vpc/default.tfvars\"\n  [...]\n}\nlanding_zone_backend = {\n  backend = \"local\"\n  path    = \"/tmp/.terrahub/landing_zone\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Immutable Nature of Landing Zone Components</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">AWS Landing Zone solution addresses the challenge of managing multiple accounts in a faster and more secure manner, following AWS best practices. AWS empowers customers to use immutable patterns for resource allocation, but the complexity of managing terraform or cloudformation scripts that manages those resources is still pretty big.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">That is why terraform module for AWS Landing Zone is designed to be dynamic, therefore reducing management complexity while still keeping high level of security. Each element of <code>landing_zone_components</code> variable is a pair where the key is component’s name (immutable and static) and the value is path to <code>.tfvars</code> file (mutable and dynamic). This setup allows customers to focus on dynamic aspects of their AWS environments, while terraform codebase almost never changes.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>NOTE: In case some terraform config would need to change, instead of updating existing component, create a new one and update <code>landing_zone_components</code> list.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Structure of Landing Zone Components</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">When looking at each component defined in <code>landing_zone_components</code> map, the first issue that jumps into our sight is YAML format instead of HCL (Why? More on this later…) But what’s more important at this point is the emerging repeatable pattern. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml\">landing<em>zone</em>vpc</a> looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>component:\n  name: landing_zone_vpc\n  template:\n    locals:\n      elements_landing_zone_vpc_map: var.${tfvar.terrahub[\"landing_zone_providers\"][\"0\"]}_provider[\"landing_zone_vpc_resource\"]\n      [...]\n    resource:\n      aws_vpc:\n        landing_zone_vpc:\n          provider: 'aws.${tfvar.terrahub[\"landing_zone_providers\"][\"0\"]}'\n          count: length(var.${tfvar.terrahub[\"landing_zone_providers\"][\"0\"]}_provider[\"landing_zone_vpc_resource\"])\n          cidr_block: local.elements_landing_zone_vpc_map[\"config_${count.index}\"][\"cidr_block\"]\n          [...]\n    output:\n      [...]\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">And the corresponding <a href=\"https://terraform-aws-landing-zone.s3.amazonaws.com/mycompany/landing_zone_vpc/default.tfvars\">default.tfvars</a> (from <em>s3://terraform-aws-landing-zone/mycompany/landing</em>zone<em>vpc/default.tfvars</em>) looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>landing_zone_providers = [\n  \"default\"\n]\ndefault_provider = {\n  landing_zone_vpc_tags_element = {\n    config_0 = {\n      Name        = \"VPC for Landing Zone\"\n      Description = \"Managed by TerraHub\"\n      ThubCode    = \"1234abcd\"\n      ThubEnv     = \"prod\"\n    }\n  },\n  landing_zone_vpc_resource = {\n    config_0 = {\n      cidr_block                       = \"172.16.0.0/16\"\n      instance_tenancy                 = \"default\"\n      assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = \"false\"\n      enable_classiclink               = \"false\"\n      enable_classiclink_dns_support   = \"false\"\n      enable_dns_support               = \"true\"\n      enable_dns_hostnames             = \"false\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Let’s connect these two pieces from above:</p>\n<ul class=\"graf graf--li graf-grap\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml#L10\">Line 10</a>: this component will create terraform resource <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc.html\">aws_vpc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml#L12\">Line 12</a>: this component will create separate terraform provider <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html\">aws</a> for each value from <code>landing_zone_providers</code> variable (which in practice how AWS accounts and AWS regions are separated in terraform)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml#L14\">Line 14</a>: this component will iterate through <code>landing_zone_providers</code>, expecting specific variable for each provider (e.g. <code>default_provider</code>); that is why it’s required to define all <code>[provider_name]_provider</code> variables (e.g. if <code>landing_zone_providers</code> has values <code>default</code>, <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>, it’s expected .tfvars file(s) to define variables <code>default_provider</code>, <code>alpha_provider</code> and <code>beta_provider</code>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml#L16\">Line 16</a>: this component uses <code>count</code> to iterate through resources defined by variable <code>landing_zone_vpc_resource</code>; to use native terraform capability, define <code>[component_name]_resource</code> values as iterate-able list of elements <code>config_[iterator]</code> (e.g. <code>config_0</code>, <code>config_1</code>, and so on)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Ideal proposed structure for <code>.tfvars</code> file(s) should be the following:</p>\n<pre><code>landing_zone_providers = [\n  \"default\"\n  \"{{alpha_provider}}\"\n  \"{{beta_provider}}\"\n  [...]\n]\ndefault_provider = {\n  {{component_name}}_resource = {\n    config_0 = {\n      [...]\n    },\n    config_1 = {\n      [...]\n    },\n    [...]\n  }\n}\n{{alpha_provider}}_provider = {\n  {{component_name}}_resource = {\n    [...]\n  }\n}\n{{beta_provider}}_provider = {\n  [...]\n}\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Landing Zone Components Using YAML Instead of HCL</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Consider the following: Our goal for this terraform module is to empower users to do less by using native terraform capabilities, but we couldn’t do that primarily because HCL doesn’t allow usage of variables inside <code>.tfvars</code> files and doesn’t support iterations through providers. For these reasons (and a couple of more) we opted into using <a href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/terrahub\">terrahub cli</a> — terraform automation and orchestration tool.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">When executing <code>terraform init</code> and <code>terraform apply</code> on <code>landing_zone module</code>, the underlying code triggers <code>terrahub run</code> for entire list of <code>landing_zone_components</code>. Internally, landing zone components in YAML format are converted into HCL. This terrahub feature is called JIT (aka Just In Time) and, as the name suggests, YAML configs are converted into HCL in real-time during terraform workflow execution.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">For example, above mentioned component <a href=\"https://github.com/TerraHubCorp/terraform-aws-landing-zone/blob/master/components/landing_zone_vpc/.terrahub.yml\">landing<em>zone</em>vpc</a> defined as <code>.yml</code> file will be converted into the following set of <code>.tf</code> files:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ls ~/.terrahub/cache/jit/landing_zone_vpc_eef16dcf/\nREADME.md    default.tfvars    locals.tf    main.tf        output.tf    provider.tf    terraform.tf    variable.tf\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote class=\"green-blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\"><em>NOTE: In order to debug JIT converted files from YAML format into HCL go to <strong>~/.terrahub/cache/jit/</strong> folder and explore corresponding component(s). If specific component is missing, execute <code>terrahub run -i [component_name]</code> in order to generate corresponding <code>[component_name]_[hash]</code> folder and <code>.tf</code> files.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">After putting everything together, we get a very powerful terraform module:</p>\n<pre><code>$ terraform init\nInitializing modules...\n- landing_zone in modules/landing_zone\n\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">and</p>\n<pre><code>$ terraform apply\nAn execution plan has been generated and is shown below.\nResource actions are indicated with the following symbols:\n  + create\n[...]\nApply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">And that’s it. We hope it helps.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf-up margin-bottom-25\">Share your thoughts and your experience on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/company/mitoc-group\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitocgroup\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com/mitocgroup\">Facebook</a> or in the comments section below.</p>"}}
