# About
Delicious and light, this Mango Raspberry Tart makes for a stunning dessert that is perfect for spring or summer.
 
Who’s bringing the dessert? It’s us! Gluten-Free, vegan, summery, fruity, naturally sweetened and delicious Mango Raspberry Tart.  
Also, it is very light and packed with good ingredients like almond meal, oat flour, flaxseed, coconut oil and coconut sugar, 
let’s not forget the hazelnut flour which actually, believe it or not, gives a nice touch to the overall taste of this tart. 
The crust comes out delicious, crisp but not too crumbly, lightly sweetened and nutty.  We love combining sweet and tart flavors, 
raspberries and mangoes do not disappoint. The tartness of raspberries combined with buttery sweet mango is what makes this tart’s 
delectable flavor. We recommend using our Raspberry Chia Jam for this recipe as it is low in sugar  and has a rich raspberry flavor, 
but if you don’t have it on hand or don’t have the time to prepare it, you can use store bought preserves, it will still taste incredible.

# Ingredients
- 2/3 cup almond meal
- 1/3 cup hazelnut flour/meal
- 1 cup oat flour
- 1 tbsp flax meal
- 1/4 cup coconut sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 coconut oil
- 2 tbsp water for blending
- 2 ripe Champagne Mangos
- 1 cup of Raspberry Chia Jam
- 3 Tbsp of Apricot Jelly for the glaze

# Directions
1. Tart crust: Preheat the oven at 350 F. Line a 9 inch tart pan with parchment paper and brush all over with coconut oil. Place the almond meal, hazelnut flour, oat flour, coconut sugar, salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times until combined.  Add the coconut oil and pulse until the dough looks crumbly, add the water one tablespoon at a time until the dough starts to stick together, check it by taking some in your hands and press together, if it holds it is ready, if not add another tablespoon of water.  
2. Transfer the crust to the pan and start pressing the dough using the palm of your hands evenly on the bottom and on the sides. 
3. Using a fork, puncture the crust on the bottom in a few places and bake for 20 min. Oven temperatures vary so keep a close eye those last 5 minutes of baking.
4. Cool the crust for about 10-15 min.
5. Prepare the Mango. Cut the mango lengthwise in half avoiding the pit. Peel the cut mango sides. Repeat with the second mango. Thinly cut the Mango crosswise in ¼ inch slices.
6. Tart Assembly: Spread the raspberry jam over the bottom of the crust. Layer the mango slices beginning from the edges and going to the middle of the crust in circles. 
7. Prepare the glaze: Heat the apricot jelly in a small saucepan stirring until smooth. Strain the jelly using a mesh sieve. 
8. Using a pastry brush, gently brush the fruit with the glaze. 
9. Serve immediately or chill for a couple of hours.

# Notes
- The crust can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep in a dry place until ready to assemble the tart. Once assembled serve within a couple of hours.
- Don’t have hazelnut flour? No problem, just replace it with more almond flour. 
- The Raspberry Chia Jam can be replaced with store bought Jam, just keep in mind that it will result in a sweeter tart, but still delicious.
