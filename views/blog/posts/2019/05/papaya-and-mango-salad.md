# About
This Papaya and Mango Salad is refreshing, packed with antioxidants, enzymes, fiber and is a great addition to your dinner table or barbecue party.

We fell in love with papaya salad after having dinner one night at our local Thai restaurant. The flavor, texture and the exotic look 
made us dream of recreating and adding it to our collection of recipes. We thought of adding julienned mango to compliment the sweet 
and sour taste and bring more texture to the salad. The result was more stunning than we thought and our families devoured it to the 
last piece. It is important to choose a green, unripe papaya as it is richer in digestive enzymes than the ripe ones. It will also give 
a crunchy texture to the salad. For the dressing we opted for a vegan version by substituting the fish sauce with pineapple juice and 
using coconut sugar instead of white sugar. You can also omit the sugar all together depending how sweet your mango is and how sweet you 
like your salads. 
What we like most about this salad is that it is loaded with vitamins A, C, E, folate, antioxidants, fiber, beta-carotene, 
digestive enzymes and many more healthy nutrients. The ingredients in this Papaya and Mango Salad possess anticancer properties , reduce 
inflammatory markers, boost heart health, improve digestion, decrease the risk of macular degeneration and protect against skin damage. 
So next time youâ€™re in the supermarket grab the greenest papaya and treat your to this delicious and healthy salad.
