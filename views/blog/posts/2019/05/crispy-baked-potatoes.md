# Title
Introducing Programmatic AWS Landing Zone as Terraform Module

# Intro
AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.

---

In over 5 years of our corporate existence our team at Mitoc Group was relentlessly working to help large organizations transform themselves and build or migrate their IT footprint to AWS cloud. In other words — quoting our friends from AWS — our customers are reinventing themselves on AWS. It is a never ending effort to invent and simplify on behalf of customers, and AWS is doing a great job at solving complex problems with easy to digest solutions.

### What is AWS Landing Zone? Quoting from official source:

AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and require a deep understanding of AWS services.

# About
These crispy baked potatoes are the new healthy french fries!

A favorite in our house, devoured by both adults and children, these Crispy Baked Potatoes are great as a weekly meal, at a weekend 
gathering or at a party as finger food, however you are going to enjoy them, I’m sure everyone will ask for seconds. They are so crispy 
on the outside, soft inside and the garlic flavor is just on point! 
This recipe is also very easy to make, all you need is just 4 ingredients! The secret for the Crispy Potatoes is to boil first and then 
roast them with garlic, oil and salt. So simple! They go perfect with pesto, chimichurri or just about any sauce you like, cause you 
know, potatoes are the ultimate comfort food!
