# About
Incredible fast and easy, this mango mousse is absolutely delicious, light and creamy.

Mangos are delicious, sweet and buttery, our totally favorite fruit. Besides being tasty, this fruit also has an impressive amount of 
Vitamin C and it is loaded with antioxidants. But, keep in mind, mangos have a high amount of sugar, so moderation is key.
This Mango Mousse recipe is so good, you will love it. It is gluten free, vegan, low in sugar and is great as a snack, after-dinner 
treat and it makes a perfect summer dessert. Plus, it takes only 5 minutes to make and has only 4 ingredients, simple and fast.
