AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.

In over 5 years of our corporate existence our team at Mitoc Group was relentlessly working to help large organizations transform themselves and build or migrate their IT footprint to AWS cloud. In other words — quoting our friends from AWS — our customers are reinventing themselves on AWS. It is a never ending effort to invent and simplify on behalf of customers, and AWS is doing a great job at solving complex problems with easy to digest solutions.

### What is AWS Landing Zone? Quoting from official source:

AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and require a deep understanding of AWS services.
