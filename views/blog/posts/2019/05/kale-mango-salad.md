# Title
Introducing Programmatic AWS Landing Zone as Terraform Module

# Intro
AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.

---

In over 5 years of our corporate existence our team at Mitoc Group was relentlessly working to help large organizations transform themselves and build or migrate their IT footprint to AWS cloud. In other words — quoting our friends from AWS — our customers are reinventing themselves on AWS. It is a never ending effort to invent and simplify on behalf of customers, and AWS is doing a great job at solving complex problems with easy to digest solutions.

### What is AWS Landing Zone? Quoting from official source:

AWS Landing Zone is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. With the large number of design choices, setting up a multi-account environment can take a significant amount of time, involve the configuration of multiple accounts and services, and require a deep understanding of AWS services.
 
Kale is known to be one of the __healthiest greens__ as it has a rich nutritional profile. It is loaded with multiple vitamins and minerals such as Vit. A, K, C and many more. Adding kale to your plate is a good way to increase your total nutrient contents of your diet. By pairing Kale with Mango, which is also rich in Vit. C and A, this salad becomes __a powerhouse of health__ while tasting absolutely delicious.
This recipe is our favorite way to enjoy kale, it is __juicy, tasty__ and has just the right amount of flavor. The lemon garlic dressing we use here takes just a few minutes to make and it has all pantry staple ingredients like lemon, garlic, maple syrup and olive oil.  
Want to __save time__? Prep the kale ahead as it keeps very well in the fridge in an air-tight container for up to 3-4 days. 
Are you still not sure you will like kale? Try our salad and it will completely change your mind!

# Ingredients
- 1 bunch of kale (curly or lacinato are both fine), about 6-8 cups
- 1 ripe Mango, halved and sliced in 2 inch cubes
- 2 tbsp dried cranberries
- 2 tbsp sliced almonds
Dressing:
- 1/4 cup of lemon juice
- 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tsp of salt



# Directions
1. Prep Kale: wash, then separate the leaves from the stem, discarding the stems. Cut the leaves in bite size pieces.
2. Prepare the dressing: mix all the dressing ingredients in a jar, put the lid on and shake it very well until very well mixed.
3. Pour the dressing over the kale and massage it very well using your hands.
4. Top the salad with the Mango slices, sliced almonds and cranberries and serve. 


# Notes
- Make it nut free by omitting the almonds.
- The leftover salad will keep in the refrigerator for 1 day.
- We definitely like mangos in this salad, but if not available, they can be replaced with peaches or apples.
