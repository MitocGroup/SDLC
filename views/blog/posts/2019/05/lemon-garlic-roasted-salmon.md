# About
Salmon comes out juicy, flaky and absolutely delicious. The best part? it takes only 15 minutes to make!

This is my absolute favorite dish, it is simple, has only 5 ingredients and is done in 15 minutes. Did I mention it is healthy too? 
Wild Salmon is loaded with numerous health benefits, like improving cardiovascular health due to being rich in Omega-3 fatty acids and 
potassium, it is a good source of vitamin B complex, promotes brain health and many more. I always recommend wild salmon over farmed one 
as it has far less potentially harmful contaminants, however given the many health benefits, any type of salmon is still considered a 
healthy food. 
This recipe for Lemon Garlic Roasted Salmon comes out perfect every time, it is fail proof! The process is pretty simple, just assemble 
the marinade, brush it on the salmon and roast then broil it.  Serve it alongside a green salad, roasted potatoes or other vegetables. 
Enjoy!
