We are excited to announce that we'll be presenting [Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework) at [StackWorld Conference 2016](http://www.stackworld.com/). The session is listed in the track `Choosing a Cloud`, section `Amazon Cloud and Ecosystem` and is called `Building Scalable Web Applications using Microservices Architecture and Serverless Computing from AWS`.

Quoting conference's website:

>_Join 1,200+ Technology Executives, DevOps Engineers, and Developers June 27â€“28 in San Francisco for the StackWorld 2016 Conference & Expo._

>_Choosing your technology stack is one of the most important decisions your company will make. StackWorld is San Francisco's largest technology conference 100% focused on helping you choose your technology stack._

In our humble opinion, scalable applications are by nature resource intensive, expensive to build and difficult to manage. What if we can change this perception and help developers design full-stack applications that are low cost and low maintenance? This session will describe the underlying architecture behind [www.deep.mg](http://www.deep.mg%2C/), the microservices marketplace built by Mitoc Group using AngularJS, NodeJS and powered by abstracted services like AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon DynamoDB, and so on. Eugene Istrati, Technology Partner at Mitoc Group, will dive deep into our approach to microservices architecture using serverless environments from AWS and demonstrate how anyone can use serverless computing to achieve high scalability, high availability, and high performance without huge efforts or expensive resources allocation.

Eugene Istrati has spent over 15 years as a technologist in a variety of industries, including digital media, cloud computing, and reputation marketing. Before joining Mitoc Group as Technology Partner, Eugene worked as Director of Engineering at Hearst Corporation and Program Manager at Amazon Web Services. He holds a dual Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

So, are you ready for StackWorld 2016? We hope to see you there!
