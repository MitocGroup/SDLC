We are very humble and honored to be featured by AWS Lambda as one of their Framework Partners. On behalf of our customers, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank AWS Lambda team for their continuous trust and support.

When we started this journey almost a year ago, our hopes and dreams were to conquer the world with simplified web development process, where developers focus 20% of their time on 80% of the overall software development and related operations. We were tired of the opposite, spending 80% of our time on 20% of results. And AWS Lambda played fundamental role in making it happen.

Fast-forward one year later, we still aim high and dream big. We are building scalable products in weeks that normally takes months. Our customers love the fact that speed, security and efficiency come out of the box. But most important aspect of our limited success is mainly due to powerful capabilities inside AWS Lambda:

- Milliseconds deployment time
- Seconds execution time
- Performance and cost efficiency

Last, but not the least, AWS Lambda empowered our team to create an enterprise software ecosystem called Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform (shortly DEEP):

1. [DEEP Framework ](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework)— serverless web framework that abstracts web apps and web services from specific cloud services. This framework enables developers build cloud-native applications or platforms using microservices architecture in a completely serverless approach.
2. [DEEP CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepify) — software development tool-chain that abstracts package management and associated development operations.
3. [DEEP Marketplace](https://www.deep.mg/) — Software-as-a-Service that empowers customers to choose functionality from listed microapplications or microservices and deploy them together as a custom web app into their own AWS accounts.

We are very excited and looking forward to extend this relationship with AWS Lambda team. On behalf of Mitoc Group, DEEP ecosystem and our customers — Thank You!
