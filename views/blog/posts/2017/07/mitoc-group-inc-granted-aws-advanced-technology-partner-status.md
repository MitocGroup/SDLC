Woodcliff Lake, NJ — July 21, 2017 — Mitoc Group Inc., a technology company that focuses on innovative enterprise solutions, announced today that it has been granted [AWS Advanced Technology Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/technology) status by Amazon Web Services, recognizing its ability to help businesses and developers drive innovation using DevOps and Serverless on the AWS Cloud.

Mitoc Group is also part of the [AWS SaaS Partner Program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/saas/) which provides APN Technology Partners with support as they build, launch, and grow SaaS solutions on AWS. The company and its staff is very proud to join the ranks of Chef and Puppet, US based companies that pioneered DevOps landscape.

“We are thrilled to be named an Advanced Technology Partner in the AWS Partner Network,” said [Eugene Istrati](https://linkedin.com/in/eistrati), Technology Partner at Mitoc Group. “Our team has built a base of innovative products and simplified processes around AWS Lambda, and we are dedicated to helping customers achieve their business goals by leveraging the agility of DevOps and Serverless on the AWS Cloud.”

Mitoc Group is helping customers like [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/) build a new product intended to give users better access to for-pay content. “ We haven't had the best experiences when developing new products in the past,” said Marjan Bace, Publisher at Manning. “With AWS Lambda, there's a noticeable difference in the speed of development.
