Every startup has a story. Most of these stories begin with a couple of folks getting together to solve a problem they have or see. It’s not very encouraging to know that [9 out of 10 startups](https://fortune.com/2014/09/25/why-startups-fail-according-to-their-founders/) fail, according to their founders. Still, we have decided to take this path anyway. So the question is … Why?

To be honest, why not? We are working with a team of brilliant engineers that build great products and are constantly delivering cool stuff. We are indirectly engaging with a couple of enterprise customers that are using these products and are constantly asking for more. We are exposing both sides to latest and greatest piece of technology that neither of them thought about before. Sounds like [a perfect product/market](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marc-andreessen-product-market-fit-startups-marc-andreessen) fit that we have to explore, doesn’t it?

It is and it’s not.

The truth is that one evening we were discussing among friends who has the worst manager and how much it hurts the companies we’re working at the time. After a great dinner and some wine, the level of discussion was so intense and the frustration in people voices so obvious, that occasionally somebody was trying to change the topic, but we were quickly coming back to the same topic. Eventually, everybody agrees that to make an impactful and sustainable difference, you gotta start your own business. Period.

So here we are today, at the beginning of our journey. It is the hardest we could pick and the most unpredictable we could want, but we are proud of the choice we consciously took and we’ll work smart to bring high value to our future customers.
