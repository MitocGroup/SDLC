Our journey started years ago when we've been crafting and inventing the wheels of Digital Asset Management (also known as DAM) for mobile platforms. Sounds like an eternity to talk about mobile-focused applications built before smartphones and tables, and to some degree it is.

Our journey started years ago when we've been crafting and inventing the wheels of Digital Asset Management (also known as DAM) for mobile platforms. Sounds like an eternity to talk about mobile-focused applications built before smartphones and tables, and to some degree it is, but it's the roots that define the trees and are the foundation for their branches and their leaves. That being said, in this article, we'll be talking about where we're coming from, what we're planning to accomplish and who will be the real winners of adopting and using our DAM system called DEEP Management.

### How we ended up building Digital Asset Management platform?

So, back to the roots, core members of our team have been working since 2007, helping media and publishing companies to manage and distribute their assets to the digital world, mainly over Internet. Brands like [Star Magazine](http://starmagazine.com/) or [Us Weekly](http://www.usmagazine.com/) have been working with agencies like [Kargo](http://www.kargo.com/) to tap into mobile audiences. As part of [Kargo Framework](https://www.zend.com/topics/KargoZendWebinar-final.pdf), the foundation of agency's Mobile Publishing Platform, we've built KAMP (also known as Kargo Advanced Media Platform) to manage digital assets on behalf of our customers. Those assets have been stored and distributed through multiple mobile channels like WAP-push, MMS and alike, way before iOS and Android. Technology evolved exponentially since then and the rise of cloud computing opened up new opportunities to solve Digital Asset Management needs with a tap of a finger.

### What is DEEP Management?

DEEP Management (also known as Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform Management) is a low-cost and low-maintenance digital asset management platform powered by managed services from AWS. Customers can manage, at scale, large number of digital properties without compromising on performance, security or cost. Let's say I'm Chief Digital Officer at Big Company Inc. I have thousands of microsites and static websites, millions of images and videos that are spread all over our internal infrastructure and require a lot of resources to manage them. DEEP Management provides functionality that, within couple of clicks, will move everything to company's AWS account and manage it cost-effectively in one place, with minimum to none management and operational overhead. All this can be done easily in the UI by none-technical people, without any kind of involvement or resources allocation from IT department.

### Why would enterprises even consider yet another DAM solution?

As mentioned before, the rise of cloud computing providers like AWS opened up another world of digital possibilities and opportunities never explored before. For the first time, developers and customers alike can use wide range of technologies that allow them to build and run serverless environments with minimum to none effort. More than that, driven by AWS mission to provide services at high volume and low margin, our team was able to build into DEEP Management fundamental benefits like low cost, high flexibility and low maintenance. It is up to enterprises to decide weather they continue to invest lots of resources (time, money, people, etc) into existing digital systems or switch to new wave of digital systems like DEEP Management to free up their resources for other core projects.

### What we're planning to provide?

DEEP Management is our take on Digital Asset Management systems, built on top of a serverless platform with microservices architecture (as shown in the picture above). At this point, we've identified the following use cases:

1. Managing images and videos without a need to import actual assets into the system (assets can be stored remotely as well)
2. Managing microsites and static websites with full development capabilities like continuous integration and continuous deployment on top of multiple environments (development, testing, staging and production)
3. Managing logs and data that handle out-of-the-box "close to realtime" processes and visualize insights of your own datasets

Some other roadmap features include:

- Metadata management (including custom ones)
- Workflow management and access control lists
- Publishing and distribution management

### Who could consider DEEP Management?

DEEP Management is designed to help large organizations to organize their internal digital goods (and some digital services) into one place and manage them easily. It best fits in environments that require high flexibility, end to end management and want to control the overall operations without actually moving assets from where they currently are. It could run in customer's own AWS account where you own all the layers (frontend, backend, database, security, etc) without compromising performance, security and cost. If you have thousands of digital assets, you know what pain we're solving and hopefully you'll appreciate our product.
