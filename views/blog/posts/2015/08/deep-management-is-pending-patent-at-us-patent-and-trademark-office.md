For the last couple of weeks we have been working with [Steinberg Intellectual Property Law LLC](http://steinbergiplaw.com/) to file a patent with [United States Patent and Trademark Office](http://www.uspto.gov/) that protects the Intellectual Property developed by our group. We are proud and excited to report the acceptance of the application number 62/195,190 entitled “Digital Asset Management System and Method of Use”.

### What does this mean for our customers?

One of our goals is to protect our customers and our partners from malicious third parties that threaten progress and innovation. The innovation we're bringing to the Digital Asset Management Systems is based on microservices architecture using managed services from cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services.

Majority of modern systems are built on top of servers (in AWS context that would be Amazon EC2). At scale, depending on the complexity and the flexibility of the application, it would require to integrate with other infrastructure components / servers that grows exponentially the management, operational burden and inevitably cost. Our approach is fundamentally different, based on the new trends in cloud computing space known as serverless environments. We leverage and combine fully managed services (in AWS context that would be Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB and so on) that provide customers integrated components that doesn't require access to underlying servers. This approach saves customers lots of management and operational overhead, driving down complexity and associated costs.

### The benefits of serverless environments

The concepts behind serverless environments is pretty simple: no servers / infrastructure to manage. It really pushes developers and application owners to think differently, towards progress and innovation. There are lots of benefits that we could talk about, but we'd like to focus on the biggest and the most important ones, like:

1. High flexibility and high scalability — [Gartner says digital business incompetence will cause 25% of businesses to lose competitive ranking by 2017](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2598515). That's why lots of enterprises are pushing hard for adoption of digital as part of their core businesses. Serverless environments can sustainably help with digital transformation in a highly flexible and highly scalable manner.

2. Low cost and low maintenance — Forrester Research predicts that enterprise content volume is growing [at a rate of 200% annually](http://www.workforce.com/ext/resources/archive_mediafiles/Google_GSA_ROI_WP.pdf). Enterprises are managing large amount of digital goods with exponential growth rates. Serverless environments can sustainably help upgrade existing digital platforms without breaking the bank or cutting short on performance and security.

3. Low barrier of entry — [McKinsey's global survey](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/minding_your_digital_business_mckinsey_global_survey_results) summarized that “Executives expect that new digital technologies will transform their businesses, but many admit their companies are far from prepared in developing capabilities and meeting challenges”. Serverless environments can sustainably help break through these challenges and attract the right talent to execute on this strategy.

### So what are you waiting for?
