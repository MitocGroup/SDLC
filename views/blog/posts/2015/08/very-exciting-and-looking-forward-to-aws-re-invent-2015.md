When we're submitting our proposal for a breakout session at Amazon's biggest conference AWS re:Invent 2015, a friend of ours (who is also a former Amazon employee) was telling there is no chance in the world it would be accepted.

When we're submitting our proposal for a breakout session at Amazon's biggest conference [AWS re:Invent 2015](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), a friend of ours (who is also a former Amazon employee) was telling there is no chance in the world it would be accepted. So imagine now our surprise to receive this nice and friendly email (shown in above picture) saying it was accepted. At some point, we're looking into the email's headers to see if it's not a joke orchestrated by the same friend.

### Why it's such a big deal?

Again, quoting our friend: "Last year couple of hundreds of proposals have been received by AWS re:Invent 2014 team and only twenty-ish of them have been accepted." Therefore it's a very small (single digit) probability that young and tiny startup like [Mitoc Group](http://www.mitocgroup.com/) would be accepted to present. Combine that with the size of AWS (at the time of writing — [over 1M active customers](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/amazon-web-services-passes-milestone-1m-customers/) and [on course to become more than $6B business](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/amazons-aws-unit-reports-q2-revenue-of-1-8b-391m-profit/)) and it's partners ecosystem (at the time of writing — [1287 Consulting Partners](http://www.aws-partner-directory.com/PartnerDirectory/PartnerSearch?type=SI) and [958 Technology Partners](http://www.aws-partner-directory.com/PartnerDirectory/PartnerSearch?type=ISV)), this is mission impossible!

Nevertheless, we've been selected. We are very humble and would like to thank AWS re:Invent 2015 team for trusting us to present such a hot topic like "Microservices Architecture for Digital Plaforms with Lambda, CloudFront and DynamoDB". We believe that lots of technical people, regardless of software engineers or hardware engineers, solutions architects or dev-/sys-ops, management or decisions making, would benefit from a little bit of hands on experience with serverless digital platforms using managed services from AWS.

### What is AWS re:Invent?

In case you've never heard of re:Invent from Amazon Web Services, we'll quote from the conference's [official website](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/):

>_AWS re:Invent is the Amazon Web Services annual user conference. The event features keynote announcements, training and certification opportunities, over 250 technical sessions, a partner expo, after hours activities, and more. The event is ideal for developers and engineers, system administrators, systems architects, and technical decision makers._

My favorite question from the [AWS re:Invent's FAQ](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/faq.html) this year is:

>_How can I convince my boss to let me attend?_

Yeah, we all have been there and struggled with that... And here below is the answer:

>_There are a number of great benefits for attending AWS re:Invent. We have made it easy for you to convince your boss to attend AWS re:Invent! Use our [Justify Your Trip](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/justification.html) template._

So, guess we'll see you there and please stop by to attend our [breakout session](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1646&tclass=popup) or just [say hello](mailto:hello@mitocgroup.com). Vegas, here we come!
