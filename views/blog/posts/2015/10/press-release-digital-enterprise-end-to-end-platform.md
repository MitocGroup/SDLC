Digital Platforms are by nature resource intensive, expensive to build, and difficult to manage at scale. What if we can change this perception and help AWS customers architect their digital platforms that are fast, secure, low cost and easy to maintain? As a recognized AWS Technology Partner, we have been solving these problems for our customers for a while and have been invited to speak at AWS re:Invent 2015.

DEEP is low cost and low maintenance Platform-as-a-Service powered by abstracted services (also known as serverless environments) from AWS. This platform enables businesses and developers to achieve more by doing less. And DEEP is enforcing security by design, where end users have the flexibility to choose role-based access without having developers to write security specific code.

DEEP Marketplace [www.deep.mg](www.deep.mg) is Software-as-a-Service, built on top of DEEP, that empowers customers to choose functionality from listed microservices and deploy them together as an web app into their own AWS accounts with just few clicks; as well as empowers developers to create and publish their microservices and monetize them in similar approach to Apple's App Store.

Eugene Istrati, the CTO of Mitoc Group, said:

>_Our long term strategy is to save customers money, time and effort. We'd like to streamline their software development capabilities and empower enterprise customers, especially non technical people, to solve business problems through technology. Think of us as Apple's App Store for enterprise applications. Does average consumer knows the technical details of what Apple is doing to make iOS modern, beautiful, secure and low-cost? I don't think so. Customers just install the apps on their mobile devices and consume: click, tap, slide, etc, etc. It feels so natural to have no long-term commitments, no big upfront investments, no penalties for removing the applications, and so on._

>_So that's what we do: We are building the same user experience that empowers enterprise customers to choose functionality for their applications from an existing marketplace and deploy them together into their own AWS accounts with just few clicks. On the other side, we empower developers and partners to create and publish their applications into the marketplace and monetize them in a similar approach to Apple's App Store._
