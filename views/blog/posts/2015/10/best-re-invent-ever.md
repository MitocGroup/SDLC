</div>

[AWS re:Invent 2015](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) is over, but the media, the industry and the cloud computing blogs are still talking about it. And this is no surprise, because Amazon Web Services announced [21 new major services and features](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/)!

We would like to share some thoughts while it’s still hot on what this conference meant for us. It was the Best re:Invent Ever! We have met with a lot of technical folks and learned so much, that it would take months to process it and transform into added value for our customers.

We have presented [“Microservices Architecture for Digital Platforms with AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon DynamoDB”](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1646&tclass=popup). The video will be loaded on Youtube ([Architecture Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdRxs_pGJm-qSy5LayL6W_Y)) and the slides will be loaded on Slideshare ([Latest Presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/presentations)), therefore stay tuned and we’ll repost them as soon as they will be available.

But don’t take our word for granted and look at some customers tweets:

And some feedback that we have received by email, and we’d like to share with everybody, because it really inspires us to move forward:

> _I attended your session today on Microservices. Brilliant. Very inspiring to the companies like [company’s name] who are into Application Development business. Looking forward to see more sessions like this. Demo of Deepify was killer :)_

We are looking forward to continue investing in technology solutions on AWS. And we are looking forward to help customers improving their digital platforms on AWS. But the most important at this point, we would like to thank everybody who tirelessly put a lot of effort and energy to make this conference happen. You guys are the real heroes here, so Thank You!
