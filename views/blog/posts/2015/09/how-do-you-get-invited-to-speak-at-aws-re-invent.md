### Invitation to Speak at AWS re:Invent

There is no secret back channel or something. At least not for us. Everything was very simple and transparent. In May 2015, AWS opened up to speakers and invited everybody to submit presentations, which we did. Here is an excerpt from the breakout session submission guidance:

>_At its core, AWS re:Invent is a learning conference. We count on sessions to educate attendees using real case studies, best practices, lessons learned, demos, or technical tips. Sessions should appeal to a skilled developer audience, going deep on AWS technologies and solutions. While AWS is already planning for sessions covering its core services, we are always looking for standout customer stories, unique AWS implementations and examples of successful collaborations with our partners._

Since AWS re:Invent is a learning conference, the main and only tip that we can give you: Come up with a session that will help people to learn something relevant and cool. We believe that our presentation was selected for 3 reasons:

1. Microservices Architecture for Digital Platforms
2. Serverless Digital Environments on AWS
3. Digital Asset Management system using above approach

### Tips for Next Year
This year is already closed for new sessions, but there is next year. And the truth is: There is no cheat sheet. So try to think proactively, do what you are passioned about and if what you do will be of industry interest, AWS will definitely pick your proposal.

And if you are attending the conference this year, please join our breakout session: [ARC201 â€” Microservices Architecture for Digital Platforms with AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon DynamoDB](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1646&tclass=popup)
