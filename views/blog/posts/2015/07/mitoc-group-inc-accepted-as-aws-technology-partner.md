Although we’ve been quiet for almost 2 months, our team has been heads down and working hard to achieve difficult milestones. Today we can proudly talk about our first major achievement — accepted as Official AWS Technology Partner: [https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?id=001E0000018XsYSIA0](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?id=001E0000018XsYSIA0).

To provide a little bit of insight why this is great for a small group like ours, I think it’s important to start from the vision and the mission that we’ve all committed when we’ve started this company. Our mission is to enable businesses and developers to provide high-value products and services in a constantly changing digital world. We’ve been using AWS at the core of our business for a while and it’s a huge privilege to be able to partner with such a great company, that inspires us to do great things!

We are humble to recognize the value and the big responsibility that comes with this partnership. And we are ready to provide great products and great services, knowing that we can rely on AWS as our infrastructure provider. We are looking forward to continue to help our customers, who’ll benefit the most from this partnership. Thank you for trusting us to do the best!
